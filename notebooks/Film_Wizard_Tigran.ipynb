These are knives\\n made of bronze for surgical purposes.\\n They give us an idea of\\n an advanced civilization.\\n As a matter of fact, two\\n famous Peruvian surgeons\\n recently performed an operation\\n using the very same knives\\n for skull surgery.\\n It was a very successful one.\\n These textiles are considered\\n among the finest in the world,\\n including the most perfect\\n ones of the Egyptians.\\n Many great discoveries are\\n the result of purest chance.\\n A native trades the\\n secret to a hidden city\\n for a glass of chicha.\\n A child seeks a lost lamb on a hillside\\n and finds the Rosetta Stone.\\n The earth shakes, as it did in 1950,\\n and opens a secret room,\\n and we have in our hands a stone map\\n showing the way to the tombs\\n of the rulers of Machu Picchu and Cuzco.\\n And now, here you see a fine collection\\n of pots, trays and dishes\\n in different shapes\\n and decorations.\\n - She reminds me of my mother.\\n - Mm, your mother is very pretty.\\n - Yeah.\\n - You're thinking of\\n changing horses in midstream?\\n - Wouldn't you?\\n (woman chuckles)\\n - These big vases named aryballos,\\n for their similarity to the Greek ones,\\n were used in the preparation of chicha.\\n It was found in 1915,\\n in a tomb just outside Cuzco.\\n And now for the piece de resistance.\\n (all gasp)\\n - [Harry] There's a million\\n dollars within reach.\\n - I thought you were all\\n talked out, Mr. Steele.\\n - Not on this subject.\\n (Juan chuckles)\\n - Where did they come from?\\n - Uh, the large relic was a gift\\n from the great Spanish\\n conqueror, Vizarron.\\n This small sunburst is pure Inca.\\n - A sunburst like that,\\n only twice as big, was stolen\\n from the Inca Temple of the\\n Sun nearly four centuries ago.\\n It had 119 pure diamonds,\\n 243 other precious stones,\\n and weighed nearly 30 pounds.\\n Pure gold.\\n It's never been found.\\n There's a legend that the Inca empire\\n was destroyed by the gods\\n because the sunburst disappeared.\\n The Indians believe their\\n empire will be restored\\n if they find the sacred sunburst.\\n This one's big brother.\\n - Is there really such\\n a sunburst somewhere?\\n - Well, if there isn't,\\n archaeologists have dug up half of Peru\\n just to look at some\\n old ruins and mummies.\\n (all laughing)\\n (all chattering)\\n (lively music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - Oh, good evening, Harry.\\n - Good evening, Mr. Winston.\\n - Miss Winston.\\n - Hello.\\n - We, uh, thought we'd\\n like to see some nightlife.\\n Maybe you could help us.\\n - Well, not much to see.\\n Some native dances maybe,\\n if you're interested.\\n -

[Harry] Now you know.\\n - I called Mr. Morgan.\\n He said you would help me.\\n - Mr. Morgan says a lot of things.\\n How'd you know where to find him?\\n - Nina Costa sent me\\n from the Club Granada in La Paz.\\n I worked for her.\\n Dancing.\\n -

[Elena] I want to get\\n into the United States.\\n - Why don't you ask me something easy,\\n like a nice murder,\\n or a boatload of penicillin?\\n - All T wish from you is to go north.\\n If I can get to Mexico,\\n I will be that much closer to the States.\\n - Even that might take a little time.\\n - You will help me?\\n - Don't rush me.\\n How'd you get across the Bolivian border?\\n - I got across at Lake Titicaca.\\n - Gave the guards a smile\\n instead of your papers, huh?\\n - I have no papers.\\n - Any particular reason\\n why you left La Paz?\\n - Police.\\n No visible means of support.\\n - They need glasses.\\n (snapping fingers)\\n Order us both another drink.\\n I've been saving up.\\n Hello?\\n Okay.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n Over here.\\n That was Morgan on the phone.\\n There's a report on you from La Paz.\\n Apparently, you're pretty hot cargo.\\n - I must go north.\\n - I know a man who might be\\n able to get you into Ecuador.\\n He has very expensive habits, though.\\n - Without your help,\\n I'm in serious trouble.\\n - I'm not cheap, either.\\n - I know I can depend on you.\\n - Maybe you don't hear good.\\n How much money have you got?\\n - About $50.\\n - You're still in trouble.\\n - But it's all the money I have.\\n - That's not money.\\n That's tips.\\n It'd cost me that much\\n just to get an appointment with this guy.\\n I'm sorry, but the wheels\\n just don't turn for 50 bucks.\\n - You won't help me?\\n - I'm not your Uncle Harry.\\n It's a very good act.\\n Very good indeed.\\n - It usually works.\\n - I've seen so many women cry,\\n it doesn't impress me anymore.\\n (Elena sobbing)\\n I got you a room.\\n That's the most I can do for you,\\n unless you want a guided tour of Cuzco.\\n You can stay here a few days anyway.\\n - Thank you.\\n It's no use.\\n He'll come after me.\\n - Who will?\\n - The Romanian Council.\\n He flew to La Paz to get me.\\n They'll do anything to\\n get their refugee back\\n behind the Iron Curtain.\\n He follow me.\\n - Well, there aren't any\\n passenger flights for Friday.\\n - He flies a plane himself.\\n - Flies his own plane?\\n This guy from the embassy?\\n Large or small?\\n - Small, I think.\\n Why?\\n - It's kind of a hobby of mine.\\n Planes.\\n He's in La Paz, you said.\\n What's his name?\\n - Marcu.\\n Anton Marcu.\\n - You get some sleep.\\n I'll see you later.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n My name's Steele.\\n Harry Steele.\\n - What do you want?\\n - You left your key\\n in the lock.\\n I thought maybe you were\\n looking for company.\\n - No.\\n - Well, the least you could say is maybe.\\n - I said no.\\n - I came to tell you something.\\n You won't like it.\\n - The police.\\n They know where I am?\\n - Worse than that.\\n This guy Marcu knows.\\n - How could he find out?\\n - Oh, some heel must have told him.\\n Hey, wait.\\n Not so fast.\\n He can't get here till tomorrow.\\n Besides, I want you here when he comes.\\n - I am beginning to wonder\\n about you, Mr. Steele.\\n You will forgive me,\\n but I'm very suspicious.\\n - No one trusts me.\\n - Marcu.\\n Why is he important to you?\\n - Because he's coming by plane.\\n A nice private plane.\\n - To get me, to take me back if I'm here.\\n - I guess I'll have to be honest with you.\\n - It would be a nice change.\\n - I hate to tell the truth,\\n but I want that plane.\\n I want it so bad, I can taste it.\\n - How does that concern me?\\n - You're my bait.\\n When this guy gets here, I\\n dangle you in front of him\\n till I get my hooks in that plane.\\n -

All right, I will wait for the plane.\\n How can we get it from him?\\n - All we need are the keys.\\n You could get 'em easily.\\n - How?\\n - He'll have 'em in his pants pocket.\\n Okay.\\n I'll think of something else.\\n - Mr. Steele.\\n You told Marcu I was here, Mr. Steele?\\n - Call me Harry.\\n (Charlie speaking\\n foreign language over pa)\\n - Clear runway for plane now landing.\\n Looks like the plane\\n you've been waiting for.\\n - It is.\\n A friend of mine.\\n I talked to him on the phone last night.\\n He asked me to order\\n a load of gas for him.\\n - Okay.\\n Who shall I charge it to?\\n - Masca.\\n Marcu.\\n M-A-R-C-U.\\n He wanted high test.\\n -

Got to watch your feet up here.\\n It's two miles straight down.\\n (Harry speaking foreign language)\\n - Not right away.\\n You have come at a very important time.\\n - You speak English.\\n I learned to at the University of Cuzco.\\n - What's going on down there?\\n - They're bringing out the Mama Cuna,\\n what you call a high priestess.\\n We found her mummy this morning.\\n - I don't believe in\\n disturbing the dead myself.\\n Found any treasure?\\n - Not yet.\\n But we're hoping to find the\\n tomb of our last Inca chief.\\n - People have been looking for\\n Manco's tomb for a long time.\\n - You know his name?\\n - But not yours.\\n - My name is Pachacutec.\\n And you?\\n -

What about Manco's tomb?\\n Do you expect to find the sunburst?\\n - You know about the sunburst?\\n - A little.\\n Everyone knows a little about it.\\n - The sunburst was a legendary\\n treasure of the Incas.\\n - I have heard about it.\\n - You said legendary.\\n - I don't believe it exists.\\n I imagine it has long since\\n been melted down and destroyed.\\n In archaeology, we soon\\n learn that objects made\\n of ordinary metal\\n will survive the years and all of history.\\n Objects made of gold don't\\n survive those who make them.\\n - The moral being that\\n gold's worth melting.\\n - Depends on how you\\n look at it, Mr. Steele.\\n - Call me Harry.\\n (lively music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - With your permission.\\n - Of course.\\n Kori-Tica has great pride in her race.\\n She believes in the ancient customs.\\n Sundown, she obeys the Inca laws.\\n -

Archaeologists have to be gentle.\\n Things crumble into dust, you know.\\n - I won't crumble for\\n many years yet. (chuckles)\\n - I didn't mean you.\\n - I know.\\n Good night.\\n - Good night.\\n - I like you, Dr. Moore head.\\n I like you very much.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Oh, there you are.\\n I've been looking all over for you.\\n Now, tell me, Doctor,\\n what's your opinion of\\n the Inca civilization\\n now that you've had an\\n opportunity of study?\\n (grand orchestral music)\\n (horns blowing)\\n How did you get here?\\n - Followed my nose, boy.\\n Followed my nose.\\n - Well, follow it right back home again.\\n - Oh, no.\\n Before it was all in fun.\\n This is business, Harry.\\n I'm here and I'm staying.\\n - Okay, Ed.\\n I know when I've had it.\\n Business is business.\\n If you were smart enough\\n to figure out where I went,\\n you're smart enough to be a\\n big help to me in the clutch.\\n - That's very nice of you, Harry.\\n This what you're looking for?\\n You and me with our little business.\\n We just had a meeting\\n and we elected a new\\n chairman of the board.\\n These six votes are for me.\\n Sit down, over there.\\n - Anybody else know where I went?\\n - Not even looking for you.\\n Make you feel better?\\n - Why aren't they looking for me?\\n - The guy you stole the plane from\\n didn't make any complaint.\\n - Didn't want word to get\\n back home that he'd goofed.\\n - That's the way it figures.\\n Anyhow, you're in the\\n clear, except with me.\\n - What about you?\\n - Oh, I'm way ahead now.\\n Before I was behind you,\\n but now I'm way ahead.\\n To start with, hand over that rock.\\n - What if I say no?\\n - Harry, I'm so mad at you,\\n I could put a big hole in your head,\\n talk my way out of it afterwards.\\n With your record, I might just make it.\\n Now come with it.\\n - What now?\\n - Now we'll talk.\\n That expedition,\\n I heard about it in Cuzco after you left.\\n How far have they got with the digging?\\n - They're about to enter the main tomb.\\n - Manco's tomb?\\n - Looks that way.\\n - The sunburst is there?\\n - That's what it says on the stone.\\n - That's nice.\\n Oh, that's very nice.\\n - And while your feelings\\n are good, what about us?\\n You and me.\\n - 50-50, down the middle.\\n We get the sunburst and we\\n go out of here together.\\n When we get to a human place,\\n we divide it up, down the middle.\\n - (laughing) I got a mental image\\n of you giving me a square shake.\\n - If you don't trust\\n me, don't sleep nights.\\n - What about the girl?\\n - I like girls.\\n This one, what I saw of her,\\n could wind up with all I've got\\n if she works at it.\\n - You're pretty crummy, Ed.\\n - And you, Harry, you're all right, huh?\\n - Come on.\\n Better meet people while\\n I figure out a good reason\\n for an ape like you being here.\\n - I'll remember you, Harry.\\n You and your mouth.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Dr. Moore head.\\n - Hmm?\\n - This is Ed Morgan, a friend of mine.\\n This is Dr. Moore head, the\\n head of the expedition here.\\n - Nice little place you got here, Doc.\\n - Mr. Morgan brought up the gasoline\\n I needed from Cuzco.\\n And I was able to get out a\\n message on the plane radio\\n just before we landed.\\n I didn't know whether\\n anybody heard it or not.\\n - I got word of it.\\n Decided to bring the gas myself.\\n Isn't anything I wouldn't\\n do for the big fella.\\n - How did you know we were up here?\\n - Probably met the runner\\n we sent down the river.\\n - That's just what happened, Doc.\\n Met the little ol' runner.\\n He told me my buddy was here and needed me\\n and here I am.\\n That's friendship.\\n - One friend like Morgan\\n here is all a man needs.\\n More?\\n (Ed chuckles)\\n - I will have to find a\\n place for you to stay.\\n - Oh, I I'll bunk in with my buddy.\\n We hate to be separated.\\n Don't we, Harry?\\n - I can hardly sleep nights.\\n By the way, Doctor, we'll be leaving soon,\\n but I thought as long as we were up here,\\n I might do a little hunting.\\n Thought you might lend me a rifle.\\n - Oh, we're up too high.\\n There's no game around here.\\n - I'll find something to shoot at.\\n - [Dr. Moorhead] We\\n don't have any firearms.\\n No use for them.\\n - Too bad.\\n Well, that's that.\\n We'll go shooting some other time, maybe.\\n - I can't wait.\\n - Dr. Moore head, Dr. Menzes would like you\\n and Colonel Cardoza to\\n meet him at the main tomb.\\n - Oh, yes.\\n Excuse me.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - Do you mind if I came with, Doc?\\n I won't get in your way.\\n Just a quiet little mouse, that's me.\\n - If you're interested.\\n - Interested?\\n I've been a lover of art from way back.\\n Spend all my time in the museum,\\n if I could.\\n - That Morgan, what is he doing here?\\n - You know he's doing.\\n - You're bad enough.\\n But he's something special.\\n - That's funny.\\n He likes you.\\n - Harry, before I didn't ask a favour.\\n But I ask now.\\n Why don't we leave, you and I, right away?\\n - And miss all the native dances?\\n - I won't ask again.\\n Whatever happens now, it's your affair.\\n - The doc's a nice guy, isn't he?\\n Kind of polite, very gentle.\\n I notice he's all charged up about you,\\n in a kind of \\\"Yes, ma'am,\\n no, ma'am\\\" sort of way.\\n Wouldn't surprise me\\n a bit if you got a bid\\n to marry the guy.\\n You wouldn't think of anything else.\\n That way, you'd get to\\n the States, all right.\\n Maybe not New York.\\n The doc's from Boston.\\n I think you'd like Boston.\\n All you'd have to do is\\n stay here when I leave.\\n What could be nicer?\\n (light orchestral music)\\n A girl like you,\\n you're made for somebody like me\\n and you know it.\\n So just keep the doc happy\\n till we're ready to move out.\\n - I can do without you.\\n You know why?\\n In my country,\\n when you want to know what\\n kind of man a boy would be,\\n you look at his father.\\n Morgan could be your father.\\n I can see him in your eyes.\\n One day, you will not be Harry anymore.\\n You will be him.\\n - I'm too tall to make a good Morgan.\\n - For a tall man, you are\\n the smallest man I ever met.\\n (dramatic orchestral music)\\n - [Ed] You know how to read this?\\n - Don't you?\\n - Oh, sure, read it like a book.\\n What I want to know is how you figure it.\\n - Well, you've got the stone.\\n Looks like I'll have to depend on you.\\n - Yup.\\n That's the way it's gonna be.\\n Leave everything to your old buddy.\\n Okay, buddy?\\n - Sure.\\n You're my buddy.\\n - (chuckles) It's getting dark.\\n That's the way I like it.\\n I don't know why, but I\\n always move around better\\n when it's dark.\\n I come to life.\\n - Like a bat.\\n - Go easy, Harry.\\n I'm trying hard to like you.\\n - Why?\\n - Okay, let it go.\\n Might be important later.\\n Maybe later you'll wish I liked you.\\n - I'll let you know.\\n - Sure am glad it's getting dark.\\n Nobody ever made a buck in daylight.\\n We'll make plenty on this.\\n I've been hearing about\\n that sunburst 14 years now.\\n You know, we'll sit\\n around and pick it over\\n like a roast chicken.\\n A piece for you and a piece for me.\\n Huh?\\n What about that?\\n Man, I wish we could get\\n in that tomb tonight.\\n What are you staring at?\\n - Sort of a mirror.\\n - Huh?\\n Hey, you're coming all unglued.\\n There ain't no mirror in here.\\n Getting through to ya, huh?\\n Thinking about that sunburst,\\n how it feels holding it in your hands.\\n One million dollars.\\n Think about it, Harry.\\n One million dollars right in your hand.\\n Makes me shake just to think of it.\\n - It's only money.\\n - (chuckles) \\\"Only,\\\" he says,\\n and I can't stop shaking.\\n It's waiting around,\\n standing, waiting around.\\n I don't know ho you can\\n lay around like you do.\\n - I'm thinking.\\n - Think on your feet, like I do.\\n - It's better if I lie down.\\n That way, I won't throw up.\\n (dramatic orchestral music)\\n (singing in foreign language)\\n (Kori-Tica vocalising)\\n (singing in foreign language)\\n (lively music)\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Hello.\\n I thought perhaps I might\\n find Kori-Tica here.\\n I wanted to ask her\\n advice about something.\\n - She's gone, but perhaps\\n I could give you advice.\\n - I wouldn't be surprised.\\n It's about you.\\n - What advice can I give you?\\n - I'll get to it later.\\n You know what this is?\\n It's called the Intihuatana,\\n the place where the sun is tied.\\n It's in such a position that\\n once a year the sun strikes it\\n exactly in the centre.\\n The Mama Cuna used to hide\\n the jewel led sunburst,\\n and when the sun touched\\n the centre of the stone,\\n she'd hold the sunburst aloft\\n as a symbol that the sun was\\n again the captive of the Incas.\\n Will you marry me?\\n - What did you say?\\n - I'm not very good at this.\\n I mean, proposing.\\n That's what I wanted advice about.\\n - But you don't know me.\\n - That's not an answer.\\n - I am, I'm not very nice.\\n You know where I worked\\n before I came here?\\n A place in La Paz called the Club Granada.\\n Downstairs, there is a band\\n and some tired entertainers.\\n I don't like climbing stairs.\\n - Neither do 1.\\n - You don't listen to me.\\n Listen.\\n For two years, nearly three,\\n I've been trying to get\\n to the United States.\\n And I tell you, there is nothing\\n a woman can do about that\\n without help from a man.\\n And I have no money to pay for help.\\n Now you are listening?\\n - Yes.\\n But it doesn't change anything.\\n Not with me.\\n - You are crazy.\\n - No, just determined.\\n I've wasted too much time.\\n I suddenly realised that\\n the first time I met you.\\n This is important to me.\\n I know it's quick, but it's important.\\n You want to get to the United States.\\n Come with me as my wife.\\n - You'll take me to New York?\\n - Anywhere you like.\\n - California, maybe.\\n Where they have all the apples.\\n - (chuckling) You're thinking of oranges.\\n -Tam?\\n - California's famous for oranges.\\n - Could I ask you something?\\n Something important?\\n Who cut down the cherry tree?\\n - George Washington.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n It looks like the main tomb.\\n (man coughing)\\n We'll need dust masks.\\n Only members of the expedition\\n will be allowed to enter the tomb.\\n All others must wait outside.\\n - Hey, what's the idea?\\n We got as much right in there as anybody.\\n Tell him, Harry.\\n - You tell him, loudmouth.\\n - Huh?\\n Oh, all right, I, I got a little excited.\\n Never mind.\\n - Let me have the light.\\n - [Cardoza] Look.\\n The sunburst.\\n - It's carved out of the stone.\\n So much for the legend\\n of the golden sunburst.\\n - The legend never said it was gold.\\n And now we know why.\\n I never believed in it, myself.\\n - I did.\\n My people did.\\n No, there's no mistake.\\n That is not the true sunburst.\\n - Dr. Perez, come and look at this.\\n You ever seen anything like that before?\\n That insert.\\n Looks like it's made out of quartz.\\n (man speaking foreign language)\\n - What's he saying?\\n - They've opened the tomb.\\n It's Manco's, all right.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n Something about a sunburst.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - What's all that?\\n What about the sunburst?\\n - This is gonna be sort of a\\n slug in the belly for you, Ed.\\n They found the sunburst, all right.\\n - Right, then they've\\n saved us the trouble.\\n We'll take it away from them.\\n - Only the trouble is,\\n it isn't worth taking.\\n - Huh?\\n - Made out of stone.\\n - What?\\n - You know.\\n - Don't be sad.\\n - We have waited many hundreds of years\\n for the golden sun to be found.\\n The legend says that only when it is\\n taken back to the Temple of the Sun,\\n only then will the people\\n of the Inca be great again.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - There's no place to hide up here.\\n You might as well talk to me now.\\n - There is nothing to talk about.\\n - Let's start with the sunburst.\\n - It's only a stone.\\n That must be a bitter\\n thing for you, after coming\\n all this way.\\n - I adjust to things very quickly.\\n Anyway, maybe I've already found something\\n to take its place.\\n That's what I want to know.\\n - You mean me?\\n - That's what I mean.\\n - Tell me something.\\n If their sunburst was\\n gold instead of stone,\\n would you steal it?\\n - I tried to quit smoking once.\\n It didn't work.\\n A habit's a tough thing to break.\\n - You would steal it.\\n That's what you really want, Harry.\\n That kind of excitement.\\n Not me.\\n - Well, I'll be leaving in the morning.\\n - Goodbye.\\n - You're staying here, then?\\n Moore head?\\n - He knows the truth about me.\\n I told him.\\n He wants to marry me.\\n - Well, I admire his taste.\\n If you're around when I\\n shove off in the morning,\\n wave goodbye to me.\\n -

His name\\n was Matt Skearns and he was very tall\\n like my stepfather and very ugly\\n like my stepfather. And he couldn't see\\n without his glasses,\\n like my stepfather. But that was normal, because he was\\n his twin brother. Matt Skearns had come bak\\n to town to get his reven.

Something always\\n goes wrong, doesn't it?\\n Jesus! Keep your hands\\n on the wheel.\\n (PANTING) What do you want? Turn off the tape. Turn on to that road. No, thanks. I don't think you'd shoot me. Here's the deal. I'm gonna pull over at\\n the nearest police station then I'm gonna\\n let you out. (GUN COCKS) You like to gamble?\\n There are two bullets left, so the odds\\n are in your favor. (CLICKS)\\n (GASPS) Sayonara.\\n Okay. Okay, okay. Turn into that field. SALLY: Stop here.\\n Leave the keys. Can't we find some kind\\n of middle ground here? Get out. How far do you think\\n you're gonna get? I'm just gonna walk\\n to the nearest\\n police station. Won't you be a little\\n embarrassed walking naked\\n into a police station? Oh, you wouldn't\\n do that. I'll count to five. All right.\\n All right. I'm takin' them off. This is ridiculous. One. You can't just leave\\n me here in the middle\\n of nowhere, naked. (SCREAMING) MARCI: Luckily,\\n this car arrived with\\n two very nice guys in it. and everybody likes them\\n because they're always reay\\n to do favors for people. (SCHOOL CHILDREN SCREAMING) Hi. I was robbed and\\n my car was stolen. MAN ONE: Hop in.\\n MAN TWO: Yeah, come on. I got to go to\\n the police station. You remember how you get\\n to the police station? I never drive when\\n they take me there. Is there any place\\n else you wanna go? Well, just drop me\\n off in Buzzsaw. You from Eureka? No. Name's Jim.\\n This here's my brother. His name's Jim too. How do you do?\\n Bill Campbell. We were named after\\n different people though. I was named after BOTH: Dad. And he was named\\n after our grandpa.\\n Grandpa. Grandpa Jim.\\n Yeah. Do you guys know where\\n I could get some clothes? Why? Because I don't\\n have any on. (CHUCKLES) We don't hardly\\n ever buy clothes. When mine get worn,\\n I just borrow a pair of\\n Jim's here and vice versa. I need a beer. BILL: Here you go. There's always\\n field clothes.\\n Yeah. Field clothes? Yeah, this is the season\\n they come out. Yeah. And they're free. Jim here\\n plays the guitar. Uh-huh. Kinda. Wanna hear?\\n We got a tape. (STRUMMING GUITAR) JIM SR: (ON TAPE)\\n Want a beer? JIM JR: Uh... Huh? Want a beer?\\n Sure. (BEER CAN POPPING OPEN) That the last one?\\n Yep. Better make a run.\\n Okay. (GUITAR STRUMMING STOPS) We come back on again\\n in about 15 minutes. Yeah. Jim! That's my road,\\n right there.\\n Oh. We ain't never been\\n down that road before. We normally don't go where\\n we haven't already been. That way we\\n don't get lost. Except once in a while. Of course.\\n Smart thinking. Yeah. I'm out of here. Okay. Bye.\\n Good luck. Bye-bye.\\n Thank you. Okay. MARCI:\\n Bill had to walk about\\n a mile to get to the hou. A mile barefoot on a road\\n full of sharp little sto. With each step,\\n Bill was thinking of Sally, and you can bet they\\n weren't very nice thoughts. Damn. (SIREN APPROACHING) (CAR APPROACHING) Hi, my car broke\\n down back there. Can you give me a lift\\n to the bus depot? No problem. We just got to\\n tank up first. Yeah. Ugh. Jim,\\n you all right? (GRUNTING) You all right? Yeah.\\n Watch your step. MAN ON TV:\\n Guess I kinda threw you\\n a curve there, didn't ? No, four times four\\n is 16, Beaver. Yeah, now remember that.\\n Fix it in your mind. Okay, heree\\n go again. I'm kind of in a hurry.\\n You think you could\\n tank up later? Oh, hi. Oh, yeah.\\n It's that girl. Oh, yeah,\\n she's in a hurry. We could take\\n the shortcut through\\n the old lumber road. Oh, yeah. That's fine,\\n Beaver. Fine. Now then, four times four.\\n 15. Now? Oh, now.\\n Okay, sure.\\n Oh, now. SALLY: I thought\\n this was a shortcut.\\n Where are we? JIM SR:\\n Don't worry. We just lost\\n the road temporarily. It's okay. We've been lost\\n in these woods before. When the stars come out,\\n we'll have a better idea\\n of where we are. SALLY: Okay, that's it. I'll take\\n my chances alone. Okay.\\n Okay. Ready, Jim? Yeah. Jim! Jim! Jim! (DOG BARKING) Bill! Guess what?\\n That guy's coming today and Peter has to\\n give him $150,000. Hmm. First,\\n I want a kiss. I told Mom she shouldn't\\n marry him. He's evil. Here's what I want. I want the three of us,\\n you, me and Peter, to sit down someplace\\n and have a good, long talk. I don't wanna talk\\n to a criminal. I know it's hard\\n for you adjusting\\n to a new stepfather. Especially when\\n he's criminal. He's not a criminal, Marci.\\n You just don't like him. He is a criminal.\\n He is a criminal.\\n He is a criminal. Why're you so stubborn,\\n you little knucklehead? Why are you dressed\\n like Huckleberry Finn? Hey, Dudley.\\n How's Dudley? Good boy. Good. (PHONE RINGING) Buzzsaw police. Yes, I'd like to report\\n a stolen car, please. A stolen car? Could you hold,\\n please? My God,\\n what happened\\n to you? He was kidnapped\\n and his car was stolen and he was left naked\\n on the side of the road. Stop telling\\n stories, Marci. No, this time\\n it's true, Mom. Yes, this is\\n the stolen car. Well, what's so complicated\\n about a stolen car? (BARKING) Come on, Dudley. Well, I'll tell\\n you what to do.\\n You have a C.B.? Great. Call the county police,\\n ask them if\\n they found a car. (CURSING IN DISTANCE)\\n It's a silver\\n 1990 BMW 750IL. License plate,\\n 2-S-R-I-4-5-0. Yeah, I'll hold. He's been like this\\n since yesterday. He's having an affair.\\n This time I'm positive,\\n I think. Remember my friend Mandy\\n from the Junior League? Exact same thing happened\\n with her husband. Late work days\\n and mysterious hang ups. You don't know what it's\\n like to answer the phone and hear that\\n awful click again and again.\\n Click, click, click. Honey, I got some\\n business in town... Monkey business. Hello, Bill. How nice\\n to see you again. Hi, Peter. Listen,\\n I need to talk to you when you get\\n a chance, please. It's about Marci. Sure, sure, I see.\\n I'll try and make myself\\n available sometime. Hello? You found it?\\n Where? Excellent. Don't touch anything.\\n I'll be right there. MARCI:\\n Meanwhile, Bill found\\n his car, but not his walle. And the Buzzsaw police\\n were no help. In fact,\\n they were kind of weird. My wallet's gone. Right. Now you say\\n she kidnapped you? Kidnapped you and then\\n she took your car? You got to help me.\\n I got to get\\n that wallet back. See, the problem\\n here is that Sheriff Hawks\\n and Deputy Logan went\\n away for the weekend to Eureka for\\n the California State\\n Sheriff's Day Parade. And, see, I was hired\\n originally part-time just to do some\\n filing and light typing. Larry here...\\n It's my first day. It's his first day\\n as deputy, you see. And we said we would fill in\\n until they got back, but nobody said there\\n would be a kidnapping. I haven't even\\n been trained yet. BILL: You don't understand\\n how important this is. There's a caretaker's\\n phone number in the wallet. If I don't call him\\n by Friday, I've blown\\n a $140 million deal. Can you describe\\n the caretaker? What's with this town?\\n Is there somethin'\\n in the water? Not that I\\n know of, sir. Nobody said anything\\n about the water to us\\n except you just now. MAN: Sir? You need\\n a new oil pan. I jerry-rigged\\n a patch, but, uh... Okay, what are\\n you telling me? Just that we'll try, sir.\\n Definitely try. But that we are not\\n equipped to deal with\\n anything dangerous you know, like\\n a real crime or\\n anything like that. (GUN COCKS) Hello, Matty. Well, Mayor Van Der Haven.\\n That's a funny name. Dutch? Yes, as a matter\\n of fact it is. So, I guess you'll\\n be needing a little\\n traveling money. Yeah, $150,000. That's $10,000\\n for every year I spent\\n in prison for you, you son-of-a-bitch! MARCI: There was a witness\\n to this family reunion. Sally, who was trying to fd\\n her way through the woods and who was about toe\\n totally grossed out. Now there's no need\\n for threats, Matt. Just hold it right there. Oh, come, come, come, Matt.\\n I'm not like you. I don't carry a gun. I'm the mayor of Buzzsaw,\\n for Christ's sake. (GUNSHOTS) You always were\\n a liar and a cheat! No wonder you became\\n a politician! And a good one. PETER: Matt? Matt, now take it easy. Asshole! Matty, Matty, Matty. Don't be childish. Stay away from me! PETER:\\n You remember when Mom said\\n we'd kill each other someday? (CHUCKLES) She was right! Stay where you are! Ugh. Jenny, any luck\\n reaching that caretaker? No, I'm going crazy. I've called 500 numbers.\\n At this rate, I'm going\\n to be at it all week. You call all\\n the Jose Rodriguezes within\\n 100 miles south of Oaxaca and I'll call all\\n the ones to the north. (SIGHS) Lights out, honey. It's already past\\n your bedtime. Oh, five more\\n minutes, Mom. Sorry, time's up. Oh, God, Marci,\\n where did you find this? No. This is going\\n down right now. But, Mom, I can't\\n sleep without that. You're just gonna have\\n to learn to, dear. Good night, honey. Good night, Mom. Hey, Matt.\\n Matt? My name's Peter\\n Van Der Haven.\\n Who are you? (SCOFFS) Don't give\\n me that crap, Matt. I figured you'd try\\n and double-cross me. (CHUCKLES)\\n You've got\\n the wrong man. Get off my property or\\n I'll call the police. Hey, four eyes.\\n I told you\\n not to... Well, that's very good.\\n That's very smart, Virgil. So, where's\\n the money? He didn't have it,\\n so I had to kill him. VIRGIL: Son of a bitch!\\n What are we supposed\\n to do now? MATT: I'll tell you\\n what I'm gonna do now. I'm gonna go into\\n that house and I'm gonna\\n become Peter Van Der Haven. And you are gonna lay low. And when the time comes,\\n you're gonna get\\n your 10 percent. Now get! Ten percent?\\n It's 50/50, Matt. Who the hell told you\\n your brother was the mayor\\n of Buzzsaw anyway, huh? Who told you? It was me! I'm the mayor of Buzzsaw,\\n and this is the new deal! Oh, no! No, Matt!\\n What are you doing? Bill! Bill!\\n Guess what? Peter's dead and his\\n twin brother killed him\\n and took his place! Hold on. Marci,\\n it's very late,\\n and I'm busy. And he killed\\n this other guy, too.\\n I saw it on my wall! I think you're\\n having a bad dream. No.\\n Yes, and you should\\n go to sleep. But...\\n We'll talk in the morning.\\n It's okay. Go ahead, go to sleep. Go to sleep. It's okay.\\n Good night. MARCI: As usual,\\n Bill didn't believe me and I didn't know\\n what to think. Maybe it was just\\n a bad dream after all. (MATT GRUNTING)\\n (BODY THUDDING) But the next morning,\\n I realized that it wasn't\\n a bad dream at all. There was a murderer\\n in the house, all righ. Oh, shit! Esta es la casa\\n de Jose Rodriguez. EsJose? Mmm, uh, mmm.\\n No. Gracias. Come to the dining room, Bill.\\n Breakfast is ready. Marci! (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello? Hi, Peter.\\n It's me, Melissa. This isn't Peter.\\n Just a second.\\n (DIAL TONE) Hello? It's her. It's that woman\\n who's always\\n hanging up on me. What did she say? Just, \\\"Peter,\\n it's me, Melissa.\\\" Melissa? Huh,\\n I know her name now. Melissa.\\n Melissa the whore. You okay, Mom? MATT: Son-of-a-bitch!\\n (CRASHING) That's the second time\\n he's fallen this morning. Must've forgotten there's\\n a step in the bathroom. All this sex\\n is rotting his brain. (GRUNTING) Peter, why are you going\\n through my panties? I'm... I'm lookin'\\n for a tie. They're where\\n they always are. Right, where\\n they always are. Here. (THUDS) I thought you hated\\n Aunt Millie's tie. I changed my mind. (BARKING) Could you\\n call Marci? Marci. Marci! (WHISTLING TO DOG)\\n Hey, Marci! (WHISTLING) Bill, you got to\\n call the F.B.I. This is too big\\n for the police. Marci, do me a favor.\\n No F.B.I. till I've\\n talked to Peter, all right? Here, why don't you set\\n the table? Go ahead. All right,\\n set the table. (WHISTLING) Peter, we have\\n to talk about Marci. I don't think that\\n she's adjusting here. Maybe we should\\n have her put to sleep.\\n (WHISTLING) Hi. MARCI: The resemblance\\n was incredible. It was Peter\\n and it wasn't. Matt had a brutal,\\n kind of crazy\\n look in his eyes. I was really scared. But he fascinated me. That's my seat, Peter. Oh, sorry. MARCI:\\n Matt was a real monste. A murderer with\\n his barracuda smile. Mom, Dudley took\\n the high blood\\n pressure pill. (PHONE RINGING) It's probably for you. Will you pick up\\n the phone, Peter? (PHONE RINGING) Hi, Peter.\\n It's me, Melissa. Hi, Melissa. MELISSA:\\n Is your wife the?\\n Can we talk? Yeah, just a second.\\n It's Melissa. Hello?\\n (DIAL TONE) That was deliberate. I'm gonna go\\n to the police. I'm gonna try\\n to find this girl. Okay, what do you want?\\n Do you want a divorce? Uh, no. No, thank you.\\n Excuse me. Bill, Bill! Yeah, Marci? Peter's twin brother\\n went into the closet twice\\n instead of the bathroom and sat at the wrong seat\\n at the table and Dudley took\\n the high blood pressure pill. You remember when\\n you were on your\\n sci-fi kick, Marci? And you thought\\n the house in Oakland\\n was a landing spot for those creatures\\n from the planet Arkanon? It wasn't a landing\\n spot. It was where\\n they came to meet. Do you know the reason\\n that I never saw the\\n Arkanese space invaders? You really know\\n the real reason\\n that I never saw them? Why? Because I am from\\n the planet Arkanon. I am Arkanese,\\n and my mission is... No!\\n To tickle Marci! I am the official\\n Arkanese Marci tickler. You see? You see? He killed him.\\n Now he's gonna bury him. I'll make a deal with you.\\n I'm gonna follow him. If he's off to bury\\n his dead brother,\\n I'll give you a nickel. If not, you have to do\\n everything I tell you\\n for the rest of your life. That worked when\\n I was six years old. I'm not six years old anymore. Take it or leave it.\\n (STARTS ENGINE) Morning...\\n (GASPS) Hey, I just want\\n my wallet back. I just want\\n my wallet! What the hell's\\n goin' on here?\\n Slow down. Stay away from me! Just give me\\n back my wallet. Give me back my bat! Look, I'm not a thief.\\n When I found your wallet,\\n I mailed it to you. You found my wallet\\n in my pants that\\n you stole from me! I sent the pants too. I'm wearing the pants. Give him back his bat! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Are you okay? Oh, shit.\\n (GROANING) Are you all right? (GRUNTING) Okay, fine. All right, you fat pig! End of the line! Not so smooth now, are you? Oh, oh, here... Have a cigar. You know what\\n I'm gonna do?\\n I'll tell ya. First, I'm gonna\\n bury you so deep,\\n nobody'll ever find you! Then I'm gonna 86 your family! And then you know\\n what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to the bank\\n and take what's mine! What do you say to that? You bastard! (GLASS CRUNCHING) Aw, shit!

Conversation\\n Baby, can\\'t you read\\n The signs\\n I won\\'t bore you\\n With the details, baby\\n I don\\'t even wanna waste\\n Your time\\n Let\\'s just say that maybe\\n You could help me\\n Ease my mind\\n I ain\\'t Mr. Right\\n But if you\\'re looking for\\n Fast love\\n If that\\'s love\\n In your eyes\\n It\\'s more than enough\\n Had some bad love\\n So, fast love is all that\\n I\\'ve got\\n On my mind\\n [POP MUSIC PLAYING]\\n I can give you\\n All the loving\\n That your heart\\n I can give you\\n All the loving\\n That your heart\\n I can give you\\n All the loving\\n That your heart\\n Desires\\n NARRATOR:\\n In 1988, George Michael became\\n the biggest selling artist\\n in the world.\\n This is the story\\n of just how fame and tragedy\\n intervened to change\\n his life forever.\\n GEORGE MICHAEL:\\n I was massively unhappy\\n and lonely.\\n I remember standing there\\n with a tear\\n in my eye, thinking,\\n \"I really don\\'t know\\n if I\\'ll ever do this again.\"\\n And it changed everything\\n from that day to this.\\n I was single,\\n I hadn\\'t come out.\\n If I could have\\n the self-awareness\\n and the strength to walk away,\\n I could change my life.\\n I felt that stepping back\\n would save me\\n from somehow screwing up\\n my career.\\n MICHAEL: Uh...\\n Yeah, waiting please.\\n MAN: We got them.\\n WOMAN 1: I first became aware\\n of George Michael\\'s music\\n when I was hardly like...\\n I was definitely a little girl.\\n WOMAN 2:\\n I think his music was really...\\n It\\'s just there in your psyche.\\n I just think it\\'s not even\\n taken for granted.\\n It\\'s just there in the ether.\\n There ain\\'t no point\\n In moving on\\n \\'Till you\\'ve got somewhere\\n To go\\n And the road that I have\\n Walked upon\\n Well, it filled my pockets\\n And emptied out my soul\\n WOMAN 2:\\n He\\'s got a voice like an angel.\\n There are certain songs\\n that you could ask George\\n just to sing,\\n and it would make people cry,\\n just the resonance\\n of his voice.\\n And some of them\\n Are about you\\n MAN 1: It comes from someone\\n who has felt pain,\\n and it comes from someone\\n who has a deep talent.\\n Now I know there\\'s no way\\n I can right those wrongs\\n Believe me I would not lie\\n MAN 2: George is\\n in the category\\n of many of us\\n who had been blessed\\n with the gift of music.\\n But you once said\\n There\\'s a way back\\n For every man\\n So, here I am\\n WOMAN: There\\'s no voice\\n like his on the radio.\\n Oh, don\\'t people change?\\n Here I am\\n Is it too late\\n To try again?\\n Here I am\\n I\\'ve genuinely believed that\\n there\\'s something very odd\\n about people in my position.\\n But the central belief that\\n my musical journey\\n would be of my own making\\n has been the thing\\n that\\'s informed\\n almost every decision\\n I\\'ve ever made in terms\\n of my career.\\n I have a musical ability\\n which was...\\n powered as a young,\\n as a teenager, it was powered by\\n this desperate ambition\\n to be famous and to be loved\\n and respected, whatever.\\n And all I wanted at that time\\n was success.\\n I\\'m sorry\\n If I smoked your plan\\n MICHAEL: I had no master plan,\\n I didn\\'t know if I was gonna be\\n a singer or anything.\\n But, at school, I met Andrew,\\n and we formed this Ska band\\n called The Executive,\\n and we were terrible basically.\\n But Andrew and I had\\n already developed a knack\\n for writing these catchy\\n little songs,\\n and we got together\\n a couple of tracks.\\n One was called\\n \"Careless Whisper\"\\n and one was called \"Wham Rap!\"\\n You got soul on the dole?\\n You\\'re gonna have a good time\\n Down on the line\\n The \\'80s was probably one of the\\n most depressing,\\n sort of, demoralizing times\\n that we\\'ve ever had\\n for young people\\n in British history,\\n because the recession,\\n because of everything,\\n because of mass unemployment.\\n So, I think music, then,\\n was probably really,\\n really important.\\n In terrible depression,\\n you have the people that\\n come out and say,\\n \"This is terrible.\\n This is terrible depression.\"\\n This town\\n Town\\n Is comin\\' like a ghost town\\n And then you have\\n the escapists...\\n things that go, \"Let\\'s party.\"\\n Young Guns having some fun\\n Crazy ladies keep \\'em\\n On the run\\n Wise guys realize\\n There\\'s danger\\n In emotional ties\\n See me, single and free\\n No tears, no fears,\\n What I want to be\\n One, two,\\n Take a look at you\\n Death by matrimony\\n The day\\n after First of the Pops,\\n I was just convinced that\\n everyone would recognize me.\\n You know, I was walking\\n down the street like...\\n \"Watch TV last night?\"\\n And I think it took about\\n three days\\n before someone came up\\n and asked me for my autograph,\\n and I was absolutely shattered\\n that it took that long.\\n A married man\\n You\\'re out of your head\\n Sleepless nights\\n On an H.P. bed\\n A daddy by the time\\n You\\'re 21\\n If you\\'re happy with a nappy\\n Then you\\'re in for fun\\n RICKY GERVAIS:\\n It wasn\\'t all sugary.\\n He was singing about\\n being on the dole\\n and having kids.\\n And, you know,\\n there was a bit\\n of social commentary there,\\n and he was embracing this\\n newfangled thing called rap,\\n you know, dressed like someone\\n from West Side Story.\\n We should have known then.\\n Then, \"Club Tropicana\"\\n taught us,\\n \"Don\\'t worry, you can sun tan.\"\\n He predicted global warming\\n way before its time.\\n Club Tropicana\\n Drinks are free\\n I mean, I can\\'t get the little\\n white shorts out of my head.\\n Call me good\\n Call me bad\\n Call me anything\\n You want...\\n I\\'ll be very honest.\\n I was a Culture Club fan.\\n And we used to throw eggs\\n at the Wham! fans.\\n They were massive, weren\\'t they?\\n George Michael,\\n and it was like...\\n They were just\\n fucking everywhere,\\n weren\\'t they?\\n Baby, I\\'m your man\\n Anyone of my generation,\\n you really can\\'t remember\\n the first time\\n you heard about George Michael\\n if you grew up in the UK\\n because he\\'s just\\n part of the fabric of it.\\n So, there is a time of one\\n which was like a lot of fun.\\n I was going to club\\n like ... etcetera.\\n And we\\'d have a lot of fun\\n and we loved it.\\n It was truly representing\\n the time, you know?\\n Oh yeah\\n I\\'m sure I could,\\n me older brother...\\n I\\'m sure he had a bit\\n of a Wham! moment,\\n you know what I mean?\\n Somebody told me\\n Boy, everything she wants\\n Is everything she sees\\n GERVAIS: And I already felt\\n I was too old to like them.\\n I felt a bit ashamed that\\n I was liking this teen band,\\n but they were great.\\n They had something else.\\n They had a lot more.\\n And now you tell me that\\n You\\'re having my baby\\n I\\'ll tell you that I\\'m happy\\n If you want me to\\n But one step further...\\n MICHAEL: Wham! itself\\n was an absolute joy.\\n It was as joyous as it sounded.\\n They say youth is wasted\\n on the young.\\n My God,\\n what a wonderful joyride\\n for two 18-year-olds.\\n Wake me up before you go-go\\n MICHAEL: There was a humor\\n about Wham! that no one ever\\n gave us credit for.\\n We were so taking the piss\\n out of ourselves half the time.\\n How can the country be in love\\n with these two idiots?\\n I knew how to make these\\n records and how to make them\\n jump out of the radio.\\n And the idea that just\\n because I was wearing\\n ridiculous shorts\\n and curtain rings in my ears\\n would actually stop people\\n from noticing that.\\n When I look back,\\n I still think it\\'s kind\\n of stunning.\\n I mean, everything happened\\n kind of incrementally for us.\\n But there was\\n never a point where I thought,\\n \"My God, I\\'m more famous than\\n I expected to be,\"\\n because I was so busy\\n thinking about trying\\n to get to the next level.\\n But, I always believed,\\n deep down,\\n that once I had my foot\\n in the door, no one\\n was gonna get me out.\\n Yeah, yeah\\n I\\'m like a maniac\\n At the end of the day\\n I\\'m like a doggie\\n Barking at your door...\\n It\\'s so hard to remember\\n the day of the final,\\n because it went so perfectly.\\n It was like a dream, really.\\n I know that there was this\\n overwhelming feeling\\n of pride,\\n and also a horrible awareness\\n that meant\\n a kind of end for Andrew and I.\\n But on that final day,\\n I remember us\\n hugging each other\\n and knowing that there\\n was something incredibly sad\\n going on\\n at the same time that\\n we were celebrating, you know.\\n By the end of it,\\n I had no doubt that I could\\n become an international\\n solo success.\\n And as though there\\'s always\\n been this red line,\\n I see it like a red line\\n which goes through everything.\\n Like a staircase\\n to whatever you\\'re\\n about to do next.\\n And I could feel that\\n at the final concert.\\n I already had one foot\\n in my solo career.\\n Okay.\\n CROWD: [CHANTING]\\n We want more! We want more!\\n That\\'s enough of that.\\n I\\'m not ever going to be\\n a fan of a boy band, right?\\n It\\'s not going to happen.\\n When he went solo,\\n the whole thing went up\\n ten notches.\\n Time can never mend\\n The careless whispers\\n Of a good friend\\n I think he was the first one\\n that was definitely\\n an obvious teen band\\n to then go on to be\\n a serious singer, songwriter\\n and take over the world.\\n There\\'s things that you guess\\n And things that you know\\n GERVAIS: It\\'s still very rare\\n for an act like that to go\\n to America.\\n The \\'80s just spawned\\n this handful\\n of massive celebrities\\n that were\\n constantly battling the charts.\\n That\\'s all I wanted\\n Something special,\\n Something sacred\\n In your eyes\\n For just one moment...\\n MICHAEL: There was really,\\n Prince, Madonna, Jackson,\\n and myself.\\n And I just didn\\'t feel\\n who I was,\\n was bright enough,\\n or kind of vivid enough\\n to compete, because they\\n were different people.\\n They seemed to be\\n much more larger than life.\\n If I was looking for happiness,\\n this was the wrong road.\\n But I don\\'t think there\\'s\\n any way I could have\\n controlled my ego enough\\n to have stopped me\\n exploring the possibility\\n of being\\n the biggest selling artist\\n in the world.\\n So, I went with full gusto\\n into creating a new character.\\n You know, one that I thought\\n would be\\n resilient enough\\n to stand up there next\\n to Madonna and Jackson\\n and Prince.\\n Ladies and gentlemen,\\n George Michael.\\n MICHAEL: And I guess I did that\\n pretty effectively,\\n alongside what was\\n a very, very commercial record.\\n Well, I guess\\n It would be nice\\n If I could touch your body\\n I know not everybody\\n Has got a body like you\\n The attitude, he was creating,\\n like, a personage\\n as we call it, you know.\\n He was very charismatic.\\n Every video\\n was a very strong impact.\\n Oh, but I need some time off\\n From that...\\n GAULTIER: He is, like,\\n coming in jeans, you know,\\n and like tight and sexy.\\n And like a rock image and moving\\n with the hips like that.\\n You know, a little\\n like Wham! before, you know.\\n A little like that,\\n but more, like, sexy.\\n Check this out then,\\n modern day Elvis.\\n Faith, I gotta have...\\n I liked the spirit of \"Faith\",\\n because you do have to have it.\\n I remember his \"Baby, ow!\"\\n Baby\\n Yeah, I remember that.\\n MICHAEL: I didn\\'t realize\\n that people would look\\n at the \"Faith\" image\\n and go, \"Fuck, that\\'s cool.\"\\n I\\'m givin\\' you the blues\\n I was really, really\\n overwhelmed by the size\\n of things, I suppose.\\n I lived in fucking sunglasses.\\n I couldn\\'t make eye contact\\n with people. It was bizarre.\\n And another who tied me\\n Down to loverboy rules\\n I still suffered terribly\\n with insecurity about my looks.\\n It goes back\\n to a family background\\n where conceit of any kind\\n was considered an absolute sin.\\n So, no one\\n was ever praised about\\n the way they looked.\\n Well, I need someone\\n To hold me\\n But I\\'ll wait\\n For somethin\\' more\\n Yes, I gotta have faith\\n \"Faith\" was number one\\n in Britain for one week.\\n But in America,\\n number one for 12 weeks.\\n And then on top of that,\\n he had four number one singles,\\n a number two single\\n and a number five single.\\n In 1988, he was the biggest\\n pop star in the world.\\n Because I gotta have faith\\n Faith, faith\\n I gotta have faith,\\n Faith, faith\\n All I remember is \"Faith\"\\n being played 50 times a day\\n on MTV.\\n You had to be in heavy\\n rotation on whatever\\n pop station you were on.\\n Duran Duran, David Bowie,\\n Eurythmics was played\\n on MTV, like, constantly,\\n played on all\\n the video stations.\\n You really didn\\'t hear\\n any of those artists,\\n but you heard George Michael,\\n on some of the urban stations,\\n right after Luther Vandross.\\n His music broke through\\n to everybody.\\n MICHAEL: In America,\\n radio play for me\\n was substantial\\n on a lot of R&B stations.\\n He uniquely achieved recognition\\n on the R&B soul charts\\n that very few white performers\\n ever got.\\n He obviously had studied\\n American soul music,\\n and felt a connection\\n and a kindred spirit.\\n We were introduced\\n to each other,\\n so, we\\'re going back now\\n to about \\'86 maybe.\\n And it was his thought\\n that he wanted to\\n do a duet\\n with one of my artists.\\n Like a warrior that fights\\n And wins the battle\\n MICHAEL:\\n When I was about six or seven,\\n I had a wind-up gramophone\\n that my mum gave me.\\n I had two Supreme singles,\\n one wasStop! In the Name\\n of Love and one\\n wasBaby Love.\\n And I hadDelilah by Tom Jones,\\n which is funny,\\n because I kind of ended up\\n somewhere between\\n the Supremes and Tom Jones\\n when you think about it.\\n I know you did\\n Kept my faith\\n When the river was deep\\n I didn\\'t falter\\n When the mountain was high\\n I still believed\\n When the valley was low\\n It didn\\'t stop me\\n It didn\\'t stop me\\n No\\n I knew you were waiting\\n Some placeSomewhere\\n SomehowFor me\\n MICHAEL:\\n It was great that I had my\\n own voice\\n and I had worked\\n with Aretha Franklin,\\n and everything\\n had gone so well.\\n From an artistic point of view,\\n it just got better and better.\\n George Michael\\'s voice, to me,\\n was always very soulful,\\n and it was very warm,\\n and sultry and urgent.\\n He has soul. Period.\\n Soul is an expression\\n of the soul, of the heart.\\n MICHAEL:\\n It was good to be number one\\n in the black charts.\\n It was an amazing\\n thing to see, obviously.\\n England has a great love\\n affair with\\n American black music and R&B\\n and a great tradition of\\n our own interpretation\\n of soul music and that thing,\\n but he\\'s...\\n He\\'s kind of up there,\\n at the pinnacle of it.\\n But remember this\\n Every other kiss\\n That you ever give\\n Long as we both live\\n When you need the hand\\n Of another man\\n One you really can\\n Surrender with\\n I will wait for you\\n Like I always do\\n There\\'s something there\\n That can\\'t compare\\n With any other\\n MICHAEL: Making that album,\\n I\\'m sure I was incredibly\\n proud of it,\\n but I don\\'t think I ever\\n imagined it would be\\n bigger than Wham!.\\n RODGERS:\\n I imagine that the pressure\\n on someone like George\\n must have been insane,\\n because he was doing stuff\\n that was just\\n so phenomenal.\\n After you have\\n that kind of success,\\n like, what do you\\n go home at night and go,\\n \"Now, what do I do?\"\\n MICHAEL:\\n I do remember it being\\n shocking to me\\n that I could become more\\n successful than I had\\n been with Wham!\\n I suppose the whole\\n exercise was an effort to\\n raise my profile\\n to kind of define what\\n my solo image\\n was going to be.\\n But I really had no idea\\n how effective\\n it was going to be,\\n especially in America.\\n And I had no idea what\\n it was like to be that big\\n in America.\\n WOMAN: George is really,\\n really private\\n and I think, when he was young,\\n with all that fame,\\n I just think it came too fast,\\n and it wasn\\'t actually\\n what he was expecting.\\n I was probably\\n most out of control,\\n in any kind of sense of that,\\n during the whole \"Faith\" thing.\\n Being caught in the eye\\n of this storm\\n is catastrophic.\\n It\\'s just 24/7 full time\\n in your face.\\n I mean, the wind burn\\n is terrible.\\n MICHAEL: I can\\'t really explain\\n how overwhelming\\n that kind of hysteria can be\\n if there\\'s only one person\\n to absorb it.\\n When I was with Andrew,\\n it was so easy to keep\\n one foot in my old life,\\n the life that I had known\\n with him before\\n we\\'d been famous.\\n It was so easy\\n to keep each other grounded,\\n to take the piss out\\n of each other,\\n and be able to look\\n at each other\\n and talk about the madness\\n that was going on around us.\\n But when you can\\'t do that,\\n suddenly, it is scary.\\n I don\\'t know many 24-year-olds\\n who would not have,\\n at least subconsciously,\\n found that frightening enough\\n to self-destruct.\\n PAUL RUSSELL:\\n Now the problem is,\\n the record came out\\n everywhere in the world,\\n pretty much at the same time.\\n So, everybody wanted\\n a piece of George\\n to help promote the album.\\n Enormous pressure.\\n Huge, huge pressure.\\n MICHAEL:\\n Ten months of that was enough\\n to really push me to the edge.\\n And I was terribly lonely,\\n you know?\\n Me and my red line\\n were very lonely.\\n And the only good part\\n of my day was playing live.\\n When I sang\\n \"Careless Whisper\"...\\n I can\\'t remember which\\n was the last gig\\n on the American tour,\\n which would have been\\n the end of the whole tour.\\n I think it was Pensacola.\\n But when I sang\\n \"Careless Whisper\" that night,\\n I remember standing there,\\n with a tear\\n in my eye, thinking,\\n \"I really don\\'t know\\n if I\\'ll ever do this again.\"\\n Time can never mend\\n The careless whispers\\n Of a good friend\\n To the heart and mind\\n Ignorance is kind\\n There\\'s no comfort\\n In the truth\\n Pain is all\\n I was intelligent enough\\n to know I should not be trying\\n to catch up with\\n Michael Jackson or Madonna\\n or whatever,\\n which was absolutely what\\n I was intent on doing.\\n I felt that tired and exhausted\\n at being the center\\n of that much attention.\\n I suppose the way my lack\\n of mental balance showed itself\\n was that I actually\\n really began\\n to hide away when I got home.\\n And I did almost nothing\\n for a year,\\n but try and reestablish\\n some idea of the real life.\\n Music was\\n my very controlling lover.\\n I had millions of lovers\\n that I never saw\\n other than\\n in the sense of live work.\\n But I still deserved one.\\n Just one of them for me.\\n And I knew that\\n the only way I was gonna find\\n that one person,\\n that lover,\\n was to jump off\\n of the merry-go-round\\n just for long enough\\n to catch my breath,\\n and letting my heart rule\\n my head, rather than,\\n you know, the red line.\\n The red line that goes\\n up, up, up, up, up, up.\\n Sometimes you feel like he\\'s...\\n He\\'s got, like, a layer or two\\n of skin missing.\\n Like he just,\\n like he bruises easier,\\n and because of that,\\n he can write\\n these amazing songs.\\n I never wanted\\n to be someone else.\\n I wanted to be a star,\\n and I wanted people to love me\\n and recognize me in the street.\\n As a child,\\n that\\'s what I wanted,\\n but I never really wanted\\n to be someone else.\\n I believe I am a writer\\n much more than I am\\n anything else.\\n And I want to leave songs.\\n I believe I can leave songs\\n that will be, will mean\\n something to other generations.\\n This award is for\\n favorite soul and R&B album.\\n And the winner is,\\n George Michael.\\n George Michael.\\n I\\'ve been a lover of soul music\\n since I was a kid.\\n And I\\'d just like to thank\\n everybody who has helped me\\n this year.\\n I\\'d like to thank Black Radio,\\n I\\'d like to thank everyone\\n at CBS Records,\\n in the R&B department.\\n And I\\'d like to thank everyone\\n who voted for me.\\n I can\\'t believe it.\\n Thank you very much.\\n I won these two awards\\n that were traditionally\\n received by black artists.\\n And I think there\\n was a perception\\n that it had gone too far.\\n The black male artist\\n works very hard to get his due,\\n and Bobby Brown\\n had across the board play.\\n And he could compete\\n in the same category\\n as George Michael competes in.\\n That would be\\n a whole another thing.\\n I didn\\'t ask to be given\\n those awards,\\n I\\'m not going to pretend\\n I wasn\\'t happy to get them.\\n But I do understand\\n what the argument that says,\\n \"This guy is just\\n an acceptable version\\n of black music\\n for White America.\"\\n Suddenly, crossover\\n was not hip.\\n And I see that point.\\n I totally saw the point\\n at the time.\\n I just felt it was sad,\\n you know,\\n that white and black people\\n recording together,\\n suddenly was, kind of,\\n dancing with the enemy.\\n You mean George is white?\\n Are you serious?\\n Oh, my God!\\n And he is blind, right?\\n I think it had\\n a huge effect on George,\\n because he\\'d won\\n in this category,\\n he\\'d achieved something\\n that was beyond\\n his wildest dreams,\\n only to have the carpet pulled\\n from under his feet.\\n I don\\'t think there\\'s\\n any attempt to, kind of,\\n steal black heritage\\n in what I\\'m doing.\\n All I think that\\'s happening is\\n I\\'m trying to make good music.\\n Music is not based on\\n the color of one\\'s skin,\\n or, you know, this is soul music\\n or this is pop.\\n To me, those things are like,\\n it\\'s kind of old.\\n You know what I mean?\\n MICHAEL: I suddenly couldn\\'t\\n get anywhere near radio,\\n Black Radio.\\n And that\\n was the reason, really,\\n Listen Without Prejudice\\n was called\\n Listen Without Prejudice.\\n It was me saying,\\n \"Here\\'s an album that has bits\\n of gospel, you know,\\n bits of R&B,\\n some very white stuff,\"\\n and it was just trying to say,\\n \"Let me be\\n both of these things\\n \"without having to be\\n one or the other.\"\\n LIAM GALLAGHER:\\n I don\\'t know if I\\n bought it, stole it,\\n or it just, sort of like,\\n just got delivered.\\n You know, I mean, sometimes you\\n get albums like that, don\\'t you?\\n You know what I mean?\\n They\\'re that great,\\n they just end up in your house.\\n ELTON JOHN:\\n What can I say about\\n the sound of it?\\n It\\'s very ethereal.\\n It has a mystery about it.\\n George, on this album,\\n got everything that he had\\n inside his gut,\\n onto vinyl or CD or cassette.\\n And thank God he did.\\n Well, let\\'s have\\n a party pop song.\\n [MUSIC PLAYS ON RECORD PLAYER]\\n It fucking won.\\n This song, now, it\\'s just got\\n such a big opening,\\n a message, actually, I think.\\n JOHN: That opening,\\n it reminds me of John Lennon.\\n Sliced out\\n of one of John\\'s solo albums.\\n These are the days\\n Of the open hand\\n They will not be the last\\n Look around now\\n These are the days\\n Of the beggars\\n And the choosers\\n When I listen\\n to George Michael\\'s songs,\\n I think, not only he\\'s tapped\\n into his dark side\\n of whatever\\'s going on\\n in his life,\\n but he\\'s tapped into the truth\\n about who he is and what he is,\\n and what life is.\\n And he wasn\\'t afraid to share\\n that with us.\\n The rich declare\\n Themselves poor\\n And most of us\\n Are not sure\\n If we have too much\\n But we\\'ll take our chances\\n \\'Cause God\\'s stopped\\n Keeping score\\n When I hear that,\\n it is right up there,\\n you know what I mean?\\n And then you get\\n into the lyrics.\\n The ones from the side\\n is \"The rich declare\\n themselves poor.\"\\n I like it, \\'cause it\\'s\\n got a bit of a dig.\\n You know what I mean?\\n I mean, that\\'s the way\\n I take it anyway.\\n It\\'s like, \"You bunch\\n of fucking cunts,\" you know,\\n \"always fucking playing\\n the poverty card.\"\\n I like that, \\'cause it\\'s got\\n a bit of Lennon vibe.\\n He likes to dig people out.\\n There\\'s no one before\\n The Beatles that has done\\n this kind of song.\\n When there is no hope\\n To speak of\\n And the wounded\\n Skies above\\n Not only, really,\\n it\\'s just his writing,\\n but it\\'s\\n the vocal performance,\\n you know?\\n And it\\'s always just like...\\n It just always feels so honest.\\n You just believe, kind of,\\n every word that he sings\\n and even ad-libs.\\n Even him throwing out a line\\n is better\\n than most people\\'s verses.\\n There comes a point where\\n you have to write something\\n which you\\n haven\\'t written before,\\n and which your interest\\n in any particular topic\\n or subject will inspire you,\\n and that\\'s why, I suppose,\\n eventually, most lyricists,\\n do approach wider topics\\n than sex and love, you know?\\n These are the days\\n Of the empty hand\\n Oh, you hold on\\n To what you can\\n And charity is a coat\\n You wear twice a year\\n \"Charity\\'s a coat you wear\\n twice a year.\"\\n Like, just like...\\n There\\'s things that\\n stick out to you\\n when you\\'re listening to,\\n kind of,\\n pop music and whatever else\\n at that age.\\n So, maybe we should all be\\n Praying for time\\n To-do-do\\n But even if I\\'m making whatever,\\n you know, I mean,\\n I\\'d work on his case, you know,\\n but I am gonna assist you\\n \\'cause it\\'s a classic.\\n It\\'s up there.\\n I\\'d say it could have been cut\\n from the same cloth as Imagine.\\n It\\'s got, you know,\\n it\\'s heartfelt,\\n and the words are amazing\\n and the tune\\'s great.\\n That was a bit much, isn\\'t it?\\n I didn\\'t expect to be\\n as moved as I am.\\n Let me tell you a secret\\n Put it in your heart\\n And keep it\\n Something that I want to...\\n MICHAEL:\\n It was my time to discover\\n The Beatles.\\n And at the time, I was big\\n into Abbey Road and Revolver,\\n and you know...\\n And it\\'s the people that\\n you\\'re trying to emulate,\\n sometimes, that can\\n bring you up.\\n I made one record to show\\n how much I loved Lennon,\\n I made another record\\n to show how much\\n I love McCartney.\\n I didn\\'t even dream\\n that McCartney would\\n ever sing it.\\n And actually, when he sings it,\\n it sounds like\\n a Paul McCartney record.\\n Next week, we\\'re gonna do\\n some vocals, yeah?\\n \\'Cause you\\'re ready for that.Thanks.\\n Please let me try to\\n I can heal the pain\\n That you\\'re feeling inside\\n It\\'s most surreal moment\\n of my career, I think,\\n to have Paul McCartney singing\\n something that I wrote\\n as a tribute\\n to Paul McCartney.\\n I don\\'t think I would have\\n had the nerve to ask him\\n when I wrote it.\\n Sounds so fucking cool.\\n It\\'s cool.\\n Won\\'t you show me\\n Your heart now?\\n I\\'ll be good to you\\n I can make this thing true\\n And get\\n To your heart somehow\\n Yeah. Go on, love.\\n Yeah...\\n Okay.\\n MICHAEL: You know,\\n the man forgot to introduce me.\\n I heard the beginning of\\n \"Baby, You Can Drive\\n My Car\" start.\\n There\\'s this bit of film of\\n me going...\\n So, that\\'s what I did.\\n I just ran on\\n just before I was supposed\\n to sing the chorus.\\n But you can do something\\n In between\\n Baby, you can drive my car\\n I haven\\'t done this\\n in a long time.\\n [MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD PLAYER]\\n See how piano-based\\n the album is?\\n No more lying friends\\n Wanting tragic ends\\n Though they do pretend\\n They won\\'t go when I go\\n I mean, he sounds like Stevie.\\n Love this song.\\n All those bleeding hearts\\n I hear so much,\\n like, exhaustion.\\n Not exhaustion in him\\n as an artist,\\n but exhaustion in him, you know,\\n as a human in this world\\n we live in.\\n I hear a fight.[CHUCKLES]\\n Sometimes, you know,\\n like, you\\'d definitely\\n hit a pure talent.\\n Pure talent.\\n You hear hope.\\n Brilliant.\\n \"They Won\\'t Go When I Go\",\\n for sure, like, that was...\\n That was probably\\n my introduction even\\n to Stevie Wonder.\\n The version\\n \"They Won\\'t Go When I Go\",\\n it brings back a lot\\n of the memories\\n because it\\'s the thought\\n that at the end of the day,\\n we come alone in this world,\\n and we will,\\n and we will die alone.\\n And it\\'s what we do in between\\n that\\'s going to determine\\n how and what we\\'ll be remembered\\n as and what we can think\\n about in spirit.\\n So, it was great to hear him\\n sing the song.\\n Unclean minds\\n Mislead the pure\\n The innocent\\n Will leave for sure\\n For them\\n There is a resting place\\n People sinning just for fun\\n They will never see the sun\\n For they can never show\\n Their faces\\n There ain\\'t no room\\n For the hopeless sinner\\n Who will take more than he\\n Will give\\n He will give\\n He will give\\n He ain\\'t hardly gonna give\\n I\\'m actually crying.\\n So, you know,\\n it takes a massive amount\\n of bravery\\n for George to do a song\\n like that.\\n When you go into an area,\\n that, you know is sort of,\\n like, sacred ground,\\n you\\'re going to a place\\n because your heart tells you\\n to go there.\\n You have a love of something\\n and you want to live\\n in that world.\\n His father works some days\\n For 14 hours\\n And you can bet\\n He barely makes a dollar\\n His mother goes\\n To scrub the floors for many\\n And you\\'d best believe\\n She hardly gets a penny\\n Living just enough\\n Just enough for the city\\n Reason for me doing\\n so many Stevie Wonder\\n \\'cause I\\'ve done\\n in over various sets.\\n I\\'ve done like four or five\\n Stevie Wonder covers.\\n And apart from the fact, like,\\n I consider him to be\\n an incredible writer.\\n His voice, the key\\n that he was writing for\\n at that time was perfectly\\n suited to my voice.\\n His patience\\'s long\\n But soon he won\\'t have any\\n To find a job\\n Is like a haystack needle\\n \\'Cause where he lives\\n They don\\'t use colored people\\n Living just enough\\n Just enough\\n For the city, yeah\\n One more time\\n WONDER: Well, George reminds\\n me of me as a little kid,\\n you know?\\n My passion for music.\\n He and I doing\\n the \"Living For The City\",\\n I remember that that\\n was a lot of fun.\\n Oh, no\\n Chemistry is something\\n that you can\\'t fake.\\n It\\'s about how you relate\\n to each other\\n and how it connects.\\n MICHAEL: I\\'m aware\\n of the need for persona,\\n and my actual persona,\\n I\\'m not really prepared\\n to give.\\n I\\'m a real homebody.\\n I\\'d much rather be\\n taking my dog for a walk.\\n Or, you know, be with friends.\\n I feel like I don\\'t belong\\n out there.\\n Being this\\n professional person,\\n going around\\n selling his wares.\\n He had a much harder\\n journey than me in a way,\\n because if you get\\n fame and accolades and wealth\\n beyond your wildest dreams\\n as a teenager,\\n it usually goes wrong.\\n But he obviously had\\n a wiser head on his shoulders\\n than most.\\n I think\\n a lot of young musicians now are\\n kind of, you know,\\n sort of, manufactured.\\n And I think, for him,\\n he didn\\'t ever want\\n to be like that.\\n And part of his\\n reactionary way was to\\n break away from all of that.\\n MICHAEL: I was still\\n struggling with the idea of\\n having that much attention.\\n And I think, like,\\n recoiled from that\\n and I felt that stepping back\\n would save me\\n from somehow screwing up\\n my career.\\n I see, kind of,\\n hard sell promotion\\n as prostituting myself.\\n I can\\'t help it,\\n even if it\\'s\\n a complete fallacy.\\n That\\'s how I see it.\\n I am of that generation.\\n He felt he needed to withdraw\\n from the merry-go-round\\n that is promoting and albums\\n and explained\\n in a very articulate way.\\n That he just felt\\n he had to withdraw from that\\n for the moment,\\n for his own sanity,\\n that we would probably get\\n more albums out of him\\n if we just allowed him\\n to back off.\\n That was quite a bomb shell,\\n I suppose,\\n for us to have to deal with.\\n The fact that he didn\\'t do\\n any promotion of it,\\n it\\'s begs, you know,\\n it\\'s quite astonishing.\\n [MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD]\\n JOHN: What\\'s coming up now\\n is one of the great intros.\\n [BEAT-BOXING]\\n And I was,\\n not me on piano either,\\n which is...\\n I always hated him for that.\\n I won\\'t let you down\\n I will not give you up\\n Gotta have some faith\\n In the sound\\n It\\'s the one good thing\\n That I\\'ve got\\n I won\\'t let you down\\n So, please\\n Don\\'t give me up\\n Because I would really,\\n Really love to stick around\\n Oh, yeah\\n \"Freedom! \\'90\"\\n is, kind of, like this\\n funk groove masterpiece\\n that just comes in a like,\\n track two.\\n You\\'re striving\\n to make something\\n every time you go\\n in the studio,\\n half as good\\n as a record like that.\\n It\\'s the Mona Lisa.\\n Heaven knows\\n I was just a young boy\\n Didn\\'t know what\\n I wanted to be\\n Big change made, he\\'s not there.\\n He doesn\\'t appear.\\n Beautiful girls are there.\\n The top, top, top,\\n top, top model.\\n And I guess\\n It was enough...\\n MICHAEL: If you\\'re gonna say\\n to your record company,\\n \"Look, I\\'m not gonna be\\n in this video.\"\\n I think that\\'s fairly good\\n consolation prize. Really.\\n Five absolutely\\n gorgeous supermodels\\n that people\\n still want to look at today.\\n Rock and roll TV\\n Rock and roll TV\\n It changed the whole face\\n of how videos were done.\\n The video said everything.\\n It was genius, and it\\n was a revolutionary thing.\\n George had raised the bar\\n to a whole new level.\\n ALT:\\n It felt like a big statement.\\n It was really well done.\\n It could have been a disaster.\\n CRAWFORD: It was\\n a specific group of women\\n that George wanted,\\n that had just been\\n on the cover of BritishVogue\\n that was shot\\n by Peter Lindbergh.\\n It was, like,\\n \"He wants you five.\\n \"And it has to be\\n all of you five.\"\\n Sometimes the clothes\\n Do not make the man\\n Now in fashion,\\n there is no supermodels\\n like this.\\n This is gone.\\n It was like the magic moment\\n of modeling.\\n I suppose\\n that\\'s the lasting memory\\n of that whole video shoot\\n was the cost of the girls\\n and the fees they were charging\\n on a daily basis.\\n That was pretty groundbreaking.\\n George pitched it to me in L.A.\\n and his exact words were...\\n \"You\\'re the leader of the gang,\\n and unless you say yes,\\n the rest of the girls won\\'t.\"\\n His people talked to my people.\\n Yeah, you know\\n how it went back then.\\n I was like,\\n \"Well, is Christy doing it?\"\\n Freedom\\n You\\'ve got to give\\n What you take\\n CHRISTY TURLINGTON:\\n My scene where I\\'m sort of\\n crawling on the ground\\n and you just see my eyes.\\n People think I know, that slow,\\n so, like, sexy and mysterious\\n is just really,\\n I didn\\'t know the words.\\n LINDA EVANGELISTA:\\n I prepared\\n in the trailer with George.\\n He showed me how to hit\\n the notes\\n and it\\'s hard to lip sync.\\n CRAWFORD: David Fincher\\n was directing it.\\n And even though the shot\\n ended up looking\\n like the steamy bath scene,\\n there was no water in the tub.\\n I was freezing cold.\\n I was covered in glycerin\\n to make my skin shiny.\\n And I, kind of, thought,\\n \"I hope Fincher knows\\n what he\\'s doing.\"\\n TURLINGTON:\\n I remember David and George\\n working closely together.\\n He was, you know, right there,\\n looking through the lens\\n at time.\\n Everything suited each girl.\\n So, I think it was just strong\\n and we were all so different.\\n It\\'s such a fun song.\\n When you listen to the words\\n and kind of a statement,\\n it has much more meaning,\\n and I feel, like,\\n that whole time\\n George Michael\\n was about him saying,\\n \"Enough, like, you guys\\n tried to prepackage me\\n and sell me\\n \"in a way\\n that wasn\\'t authentic.\"\\n ...true somehow\\n All we have to see\\n Is that I don\\'t belong\\n To you\\n And you don\\'t belong\\n To me, yeah, yeah\\n Freedom\\n I won\\'t let you down\\n Freedom\\n I will not give you up\\n You can see the biker jacket,\\n which is burning like the fire,\\n so, it\\'s like symbolic.\\n RONSON: I got the impression\\n he\\'s saying, like,\\n that chapter\\'s closed\\n and I\\'m done being\\n public figure pop star.\\n MICHAEL:\\n The burning of the jacket,\\n the exploding guitar,\\n the exploding jukebox\\n was me just saying\\n I\\'m sick of this.\\n I really can\\'t cope with it.\\n Freedom\\n You got to give\\n What you take\\n Not only were we not going\\n to get him appearing\\n in promotional videos,\\n but we weren\\'t going to get\\n his image on the album sleeve.\\n We won\\'t get to get his name\\n on the album sleeve.\\n Would I have chosen\\n the album sleeve that\\n wasn\\'t the beach shot\\n taken from 1940 or whenever\\n it was? Yeah.\\n Would I have liked his name\\n on that?\\n Yeah, of course I would.\\n A lot of people are just pimping\\n themselves out 24/7.\\n You know what I mean?\\n There\\'s a mystique\\n about George Michael.\\n But today the way\\n I play the game\\n Has got to change,\\n Oh, yeah\\n Now I\\'m gonna get\\n Myself happy\\n JOHN: Making records, it\\'s fun.\\n And then you have to talk\\n about it,\\n which is not fun.\\n Yeah, I thought it was bonkers.\\n But then it all makes sense,\\n doesn\\'t it?\\n MICHAEL: When I spoke\\n to theLos Angeles Times\\n about stepping back\\n from promotion,\\n Frank Sinatra wrote me\\n an open letter\\n that just said, you know,\\n \"Get over it.\\n \"Be glad that God gave you\\n a gift and get out there\\n and use it.\"\\n I don\\'t think he wrote\\n the letter.\\n I actually believed\\n that was the work\\n of a publicist,\\n not the work of a genius.\\n What a wonderful letter.\\n Here, probably,\\n the greatest male singer\\n of all time is saying,\\n \"Embrace your talent,\\n enjoy the success.\\n Don\\'t be threatened by it.\"\\n MICHAEL: Now, even though\\n he\\'s the greatest singer\\n that ever walked the planet,\\n as far as I\\'m concerned,\\n I wasn\\'t taking any advice\\n from Frank Sinatra.\\n You can\\'t put a gun to any\\n creative person\\'s head and say,\\n \"Create, write, promote,\\n market, whatever.\"\\n You just have to go with it.\\n That\\'s what we had to do.\\n I had spent\\n six or seven years of my life,\\n working, working, working,\\n writing, music, music, music.\\n And then I had this desire\\n to escape.\\n The basis for me\\n going to do the shows in Rio\\n was I wanted to see Brazil.\\n And I think I made it\\n conditional that 30\\n of my friends\\n would be flown out to Brazil.\\n We had our own private island.\\n Absolutely beautiful.\\n [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]\\n I\\'m actually wearing today...\\n Some sweat pants. They\\'re very\\n tight at the bottoms.\\n This is because I don\\'t want\\n to drop raw sewage over the city\\n of Rio.\\n So, you want to be free\\n To live your life\\n The way you wanna be\\n Will you give if we cry?\\n Will we live\\n Or will we die?\\n Tainted hearts\\n Heal with time\\n Shoot bad love so we can\\n MICHAEL: In the front\\n of this 160,000 people,\\n there was this guy over\\n on the right hand side\\n of the stage\\n that has fixed me\\n with this look\\n and he was so cute.\\n I was so distracted by him.\\n But I stayed away from that\\n end of the stage for a while.\\n Because otherwise, I\\n thought I was gonna get\\n really distracted\\n and forget the words\\n or something. You know?\\n Is there still a part of you\\n That wants to live?\\n Solitary sister\\n Is there still a part of you\\n That wants to give?\\n The moment I looked at him,\\n I got the feeling\\n that told me I was going\\n to know him very well\\n and that he was going to be\\n a part of my life.\\n Is there still a part of you\\n That wants to give?\\n Anselmo was the first time\\n I think I really loved\\n someone selflessly.\\n It was, kind of, immediate.\\n Everybody, with the exception\\n of my family,\\n was introduced to him\\n very, very quickly\\n because I felt immediately\\n that everything had changed.\\n DAVID AUSTIN:\\n All our friends knew,\\n of course.\\n I remember seeing him\\n and just thinking\\n how I just was feeling\\n so happy for him.\\n The two of them met\\n and changed George\\'s life.\\n It\\'s very hard to be proud\\n of your own sexuality\\n when it hasn\\'t brought you\\n any joy.\\n Once it is associated\\n with joy and love,\\n it\\'s easy to be proud\\n of who you are.\\n The first time you\\n actually believe somebody\\n loves you,\\n that\\'s a wonderful moment\\n in your life,\\n and it was a wonderful\\n six months.\\n What a poser.\\n He was just\\n very full of energy,\\n very loving.\\n I was happier\\n than I\\'d ever been\\n in my entire life.\\n AUSTIN:\\n He didn\\'t care who saw him\\n with Anselmo.\\n He\\'d found something.\\n He\\'d found what he was looking\\n for, you know?\\n MICHAEL:\\n By the time I met Anselmo,\\n I had made the decision\\n to jump\\n off the merry-go-round,\\n and I was already\\n in the early stages of my\\n confrontation with Sony.\\n Recording an album,\\n and then saying,\\n \"I\\'m not going to promote it\\n or I\\'m not going to market it.\\n I\\'m not going to participate,\"\\n that\\'s a serious detriment\\n to an album.\\n I think we had\\n some personality issues\\n between people in the UK and\\n people in the American company.\\n Why wasn\\'t this\\n \"Faith Part Two\"?\\n We wanted\\n all those nice pop songs.\\n What do you mean he\\'s not\\n going to promote?\\n We\\'re not going to have\\n his image on it?\\n It\\'s like saying,\\n \"I\\'ll do a movie but I...\\n I won\\'t do one premiere.\\n I won\\'t do any interviews\\n for the movie.\"\\n You know, you say, \"Oh, my God.\"\\n TRACEY EMIN:\\n The moment someone says\\n to a musician or to an artist,\\n make more of them\\n or do more of that,\\n it kills you.\\n And I think probably for someone\\n like George, especially,\\n at certain times in his career,\\n he must\\'ve felt quite trapped.\\n In England, they made an effort,\\n and Listen Without Prejudice\\n outsold Faith.\\n And lots of places\\n it outsold Faith,\\n because I think it\\n was actually a better album.\\n But it wasn\\'t about that.\\n It was about the total and utter\\n lack of respect\\n that the minute somebody doesn\\'t\\n see themselves as a commodity,\\n that they have the audacity\\n to think,\\n \"My God, I am actually\\n creating something\\n and I must keep myself sane\\n in order to do that.\"\\n The minute somebody does that,\\n they\\'re over.\\n We tried very, very hard\\n to get the American executives\\n to come over\\n and listen to why George felt\\n the way that he did\\n from George, \\'cause there\\n was no-one better\\n to put that forward\\n than George Michael\\n telling them,\\n as he had told us.\\n The reasons how he really\\n felt deep down.\\n But they wouldn\\'t come.\\n MICHAEL:\\n There were executives that came\\n to London in 1989\\n and we played them the record.\\n I explained to them that\\n Faith had taken me\\n to the edge of madness,\\n that I wanted to be\\n a long-term player\\n in this business.\\n Now, any logical CEO, I think,\\n would have thought,\\n \"Okay, he\\'s gonna do this.\\n He\\'ll get it out of his system\\n and he\\'ll get back on board.\"\\n George is very stubborn.\\n He\\'s incredibly one of the most\\n stubborn people I\\'ve ever met.\\n But he was right to be stubborn\\n on this occasion,\\n and I\\'m sure the record company\\n recoiled in horror.\\n MICHAEL:\\n It was very much a clash\\n of cultures, really.\\n In America,\\n there was definitely\\n a door that shut.\\n But losing everything\\n Is like the sun going down\\n On me\\n Mr. Elton John!\\n I managed to have a couple\\n of really big hit records\\n in the meantime.\\n There was the track\\n with Elton,\\n and, of course,\\n theRed Hot + Dance album\\n came out.\\n Hey, you\\'re just\\n Too funky for me\\n I gotta get inside of you\\n And I\\'ll show you heaven,\\n If you let me\\n EVANGELISTA:\\n It was very difficult\\n to make that video.\\n It all fell apart,\\n not for any\\n of George\\'s reasons.\\n It just fell apart,\\n and he saved it.\\n Linda, bless her heart,\\n came back again.\\n We got a bit drunk.\\n I won\\'t say any more\\n about that.\\n It\\'s your stupid, stupid song.\\n This would look great on me.\\n I think George definitely\\n should wear this.\\n If that\\'s all right, yeah\\n So, I realized at that\\n point that if a number\\n one around the world\\n was not going to reinstate\\n any kind of\\n relationship with Sony,\\n then nothing was.\\n I don\\'t want to pick a fight.\\n I just wanted to work\\n with people who wanted\\n to work with me\\n and who would have\\n some respect for the fact\\n that I was growing up.\\n It was deeply,\\n deeply troubling times,\\n because you could see this,\\n it\\'s like trying to watch\\n a train wreck in slow motion.\\n There is nothing you could\\n do to stop it.\\n MICHAEL:\\n Anselmo and I were in LA when\\n he was advised\\n to go for his test.\\n He hadn\\'t been tested\\n for a while\\n and he was absolutely\\n healthy looking,\\n more than healthy looking,\\n when I first met him.\\n Within a month or two\\n of meeting him,\\n he had a flu\\n that he couldn\\'t get rid of,\\n and some red marks\\n that came up on his chest.\\n And I remember the kind\\n of terror of...\\n me understanding\\n that this was possibly\\n the beginning of, you know,\\n an illness.\\n I remember him\\n leaving the house and...\\n To this day, I remember\\n looking at the sky and saying,\\n \"Don\\'t you dare do this to me.\"\\n I mean, I was 20...\\n 27 going on 28.\\n But at that point in time,\\n you think,\\n like, that\\'s a lifetime\\n to have waited to be loved.\\n Anselmo had the test\\n in Brazil.\\n I went home\\n to my family for Christmas\\n and sat at the Christmas table\\n not knowing whether my partner,\\n whom the people\\n sitting around the table\\n did not know about,\\n not knowing whether\\n this man I was in love with\\n was terminally ill.\\n And, therefore, not knowing\\n whether I potentially\\n was terminally ill.\\n That Christmas was probably\\n the darkest,\\n darkest, most frightening\\n time in my life.\\n I remember my publicist\\n calling me to tell me\\n that Freddie Mercury had died.\\n And he died of HIV obviously.\\n And I remember I was...\\n I was crying and\\n I actually just thought...\\n I mean, bless him,\\n I was really sad\\n that Freddie had passed away.\\n But, of course, I was crying\\n about something else entirely,\\n which was the fact that both\\n my partner and possibly myself\\n were HIV.\\n GERVAIS:\\n It was an incredibly difficult\\n period for George,\\n because it was something that\\n he had to hold close\\n to his chest.\\n MICHAEL: I was just\\n absolutely devastated\\n to find out that he had\\n a terminal illness.\\n I was just devastated.\\n Even by the time\\n Freddie\\'s tribute\\n had been put together,\\n I was still sworn to secrecy.\\n I just wanted perfection.\\n Which is what I always wanted.\\n So, I went for five days\\n to rehearse.\\n Everyone else went\\n for an afternoon.\\n I went for five days.\\n Because it had to be perfect.\\n [SINGING]\\n Because I had to take\\n all those years\\n of standing in a bedroom,\\n with I don\\'t think\\n I had a hairbrush,\\n but I would stand\\n and sing to the mirror.\\n And that child\\n was going to take\\n all that knowledge\\n all that subconscious\\n easing in\\n of music from that group\\n and sing one\\n of Freddie Mercury\\'s songs\\n to the world\\n after his passing\\n in front of my lover.\\n In my subconscious view,\\n this was, very probably\\n the most important performance\\n of my life.\\n Somebody to love\\n He works hard\\n EverydayEveryday\\n I try and I try and I try\\n But everybody wants\\n To put me down\\n They say I\\'m goin\\' crazy\\n They say I got a lot\\n Of water in my brain\\n I got no common sense\\n He\\'s got\\n Nobody left to believe\\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\\n I was so overwhelmed\\n by the sadness of singing\\n the songs of this man\\n that I absolutely worshipped\\n as a child,\\n who had passed away\\n in the same manner\\n that my first live-in partner\\n was going to experience.\\n It was just overwhelming\\n to me.\\n Ooh, somebody\\n Anybody, find me somebody\\n To love\\n Can anybody find me\\n Someone to love?\\n I got no feel,\\n I got no rhythm\\n I just keep losing\\n My beat\\n You just keeping losing\\n The beat\\n I\\'m okay, I\\'m all right\\n He\\'s all right,\\n He\\'s all right\\n I ain\\'t gonna face\\n No defeat\\n I just gotta get out\\n Of this prison cell\\n Someday I\\'m gonna be free,\\n Lord\\n I\\'m very proud\\n of that performance,\\n but Anselmo was in the crowd\\n and I went out there knowing\\n I had to honor Freddie Mercury\\n and I had to pray for Anselmo.\\n Wanna hear every single person.\\n See every single hand.\\n And this\\n was the loudest prayer\\n of my life.\\n Somebody to love\\n Somebody to love\\n Somebody to love\\n Somebody to love\\n Somebody to love\\n Somebody to love\\n Somebody to love\\n Somebody to love\\n I mean, it was the most\\n incredible crowd\\n I\\'ve ever seen.\\n Everybody knew\\n every single word.\\n And there\\'s a real, kind of,\\n spine-tingling moment for me\\n where I handed over the mike\\n to the audience, and they,\\n not only sang the note,\\n but they did the kind of\\n descending scale\\n that Freddy had done.\\n Somebody to\\n Come on!\\n Love\\n Yeah!\\n Find me somebody\\n To-ooh love\\n Ooh\\n Find me somebody\\n To-ooh love\\n Somebody, somebody, somebody\\n To love\\n Find me, find me\\n Find me, find me, find me\\n Ooh, somebody to love\\n Find me somebody to love\\n Find me somebody to love\\n Anybody, anywhere, anybody\\n Find me somebody to love,\\n Love\\n Ooh\\n It\\'s not an accident\\n that the performance\\n probably most well-known\\n in my career was sung\\n to my lover who was dying,\\n who was the reason I had\\n the strength to go\\n to battle with Sony.\\n I saw it as,\\n if I\\'m going to do\\n nothing but love this man\\n and care for this man,\\n if I could do nothing\\n beneficial as a musician\\n because I cannot even think\\n of a note,\\n maybe I have a chance to do\\n something truly special\\n and change the standard\\n record contract forever.\\n I didn\\'t think that it would end\\n up in court, at the time\\n because I really thought\\n that sanity will prevail.\\n Well, I was wrong.\\n It didn\\'t.\\n Our relationship broke down\\n because they said,\\n \"No, you are this kind\\n of artist.\\n This is the kind of artist\\n that we sell.\\n This is the kind of artist\\n we know how to sell.\\n And if you don\\'t want to sell\\n yourself that way,\\n and you want to go off\\n on this journey\\n and find this other audience,\\n we\\'re not gonna support you.\"\\n The relationship\\n had completely disintegrated.\\n George flew out to New York\\n with his publisher\\n and basically,\\n it was at that meeting\\n that George told\\n the head people at Sony\\n that he\\'d wanted out\\n of the deal,\\n wanted a divorce.\\n What he was basically saying is,\\n \"How can I stay\\n with a company...\\n who won\\'t support me in any\\n way when I feel so strongly?\"\\n We issued a writ\\n three days later.\\n MICHAEL: I will never know\\n if Sony and I\\n would have ended up in court\\n had Anselmo not become ill.\\n I was absolutely terrified\\n of losing him\\n and the prospect of watching\\n him die of AIDS.\\n I was in LA\\n and the phone rang,\\n and I was told that Anselmo\\'s\\n best friend in Brazil\\n was on the phone.\\n And...\\n ...then it all goes blurry\\n for a long time.\\n He still, 23 years later,\\n brings a tear to my eye.\\n He was... He was my savior.\\n It\\'s still very hard\\n for me to explain how\\n finding a companion\\n at that stage in my life\\n changed me.\\n And such\\n a beautiful companion,\\n such an amazing person.\\n I think, to some degree,\\n the Sony court case\\n was a perfectly good place\\n to put my anger.\\n I used to go and run\\n on the treadmill everyday\\n and play squash\\n and do everything I could\\n to get rid of all of this\\n anger and fear.\\n But the best place for it\\n was court number one, really.\\n PRESSPERSON:\\n George, come on, George.\\n MICHAEL: There was the part\\n of my personality\\n that could say,\\n \"Okay, fuck this!\\n This can\\'t all be bad.\\n I\\'ve got to do something good\\n with this time in my life\\n and change the path\\n of artists\\' lives.\"\\n One of Britain\\'s most successful\\n pop singers, George Michael,\\n is today asking a High Court\\n judge to declare\\n his recording contract null\\n and void.\\n He says the contract\\n with Sony Music\\n is too restrictive\\n and that the company takes\\n too much of the profits.\\n MICHAEL: The deal that I\\n was working from\\n was based\\n upon the original deal\\n which I had signed\\n with Andrew,\\n under duress.\\n And it recorded a demo\\n of \"Careless Whisper\",\\n \"Club Tropicana\", \"Wham Rap\".\\n The head of the record company\\n of Innervison\\n turns up with these contracts\\n and we went to this\\n greasy spoon cafe.\\n And he said \"Look,\\n if you don\\'t sign this now,\\n the deal is going away.\\n \"You won\\'t have finished demos\\n to take away,\\n you won\\'t own them.\"\\n And we were on our own,\\n we had nobody with us,\\n and we signed them.\\n When you start a career\\n with a ridiculous contract\\n where someone is paying you\\n nothing on 12\" records,\\n one and a half per cent\\n on the records\\n that you do sell,\\n when you start\\n from that point,\\n you know from that day on\\n not to trust the industry.\\n This was a worldwide,\\n major artist saying\\n to a record company\\n that the basic contract\\n which record companies used\\n was invalid.\\n RUSSELL:\\n If you really fall out\\n with the people\\n who control\\n your professional life,\\n you have a right to walk away.\\n I think that is the right\\n of every individual.\\n And the music industry\\n takes away that right\\n from every artist it signs.\\n George is very, very brave.\\n He\\'s not afraid of anybody.\\n And he thought\\n he was being wronged\\n and he went out\\n and fought his own corner.\\n What we couldn\\'t do was stand up\\n and say, \"Yeah, you\\'re right.\\n \"These contracts are slavery\\n and they shouldn\\'t be allowed,\\n Your Honor.\"\\n We weren\\'t going to do that!\\n You would have artist\\n after artist queuing up\\n to take their record company\\n into court.\\n MICHAEL:\\n I can\\'t think of one artist\\n that supported me.\\n Not one.\\n I know of a lot of artists\\n who sat back\\n and waited for the result.\\n But that\\'s a different thing.\\n ANDY STEPHENS:\\n Artists like George Michael\\n come along, if you\\'re lucky,\\n once-in-a-lifetime.\\n My feelings as the court case\\n went on were\\n that we\\'d lost him.\\n How could you ever patch\\n that up?\\n I\\'d never let on to George\\n of the problems\\n until after\\n he\\'d been in the witness box.\\n And I said,\\n \"It\\'s not going well.\"\\n And, you know, you shouldn\\'t\\n raise your hopes at this stage.\\n The pop star George Michael\\n loses his High Court battle\\n to break away from\\n his record company, Sony.\\n In dismissing the claim,\\n the judge, Mr. Justice Parker,\\n ruled that the contract\\n was both reasonable and fair.\\n The 30-year-old singer\\n had argued\\n that the agreement\\n was stifling\\n his artistic development\\n and he threatened never\\n to record for Sony again\\n if he lost.\\n George Michael says\\n he\\'ll appeal\\n against the judgment,\\n which he said condemned him\\n to \"professional slavery.\"\\n Having received this judgment,\\n I would like to reiterate\\n the reasons why\\n I embarked\\n upon these proceedings.\\n I have no right to resign.\\n In fact, there is no such thing\\n as resignation for an artist\\n in the music industry.\\n Effectively, you sign a piece\\n of paper\\n at the beginning of your career\\n and you are expected\\n to live with that decision,\\n good or bad, for the rest\\n of your professional life.\\n I shall obviously take full\\n advice from my lawyers.\\n But the initial view is that\\n we have very strong grounds\\n for appeal\\n and we hope to have the appeal\\n heard as quickly as possible.\\n Thank you very much for your\\n time and for all the support\\n that I\\'ve received since this\\n action began. Thank you.\\n JOURNALIST: George,\\n will you sing for Sony again?\\n After the court case\\n was finished and I\\'d lost\\n and not just lost,\\n I lost completely.\\n I mean, I lost on everything.\\n Every count.\\n They then called up and,\\n you know, kind of said,\\n \"Well, isn\\'t...\\n Can\\'t we patch things up?\"\\n kind of thing.\\n But I knew in reality\\n that was like a formality.\\n They had to do that.\\n But ultimately, the whole thing\\n was a complete waste of time.\\n And I regret it to this day.\\n Looking back 25 years on,\\n my first thought is that\\n I just think it\\'s sad.\\n When you win a court case,\\n you\\'re normally out there\\n high-fiving\\n and putting the drinks in.\\n But I don\\'t think anyone felt,\\n not on my team anyway,\\n a sense of euphoria.\\n Certainly, there\\n were no winners.\\n I mean, we won the court case,\\n but we didn\\'t win anything.\\n You\\'ve actually lost\\n because you\\'ve lost the support\\n of that artist.\\n TONY: George said in passing,\\n \"David Frost wants to do\\n an interview with me.\"\\n And I said,\\n \"You\\'ve got to do it.\\n They know you\\'re a man\\n of principle.\\n Now, you\\'ve got to be a man\\n of principle\\n who\\'s totally obsessed.\"\\n Well...\\n What happens now\\n is that we go to appeal.\\n I can\\'t see\\n any other way around it.\\n I mean, of course,\\n there is the ultimate option\\n that an appeal at the House\\n of Lords,\\n which would take forever.\\n It was all bluff.\\n I mean, they intended to take it\\n to the Court of Appeal\\n in the UK.\\n Never to the House of Lords,\\n never to the European Court\\n of Justice.\\n They can only lose\\n by going to appeal.\\n Everybody was watching,\\n including David Geffen.\\n No-one was going to let a talent\\n like that flounder out there\\n for very long.\\n So, David Geffen\\n contacts Sony\\n and said to them,\\n \"Listen, guys,\\n he\\'s never, ever going to make\\n another piece of music\\n for you ever.\"\\n \"You might as well let him go.\"\\n I flew to New York,\\n had a very quick\\n meeting there,\\n where basically, you know,\\n we agreed that the contract\\n would be sold.\\n I was like in seventh heaven.\\n TONY: Sony said,\\n \"We want\\n this transfer fee\" and\\n it would\\'ve bought you\\n a top class footballer.\\n In fact, it most probably\\n even bought you Lionel Messi\\n in those days.\\n RUSSELL: In the end, he did\\n whatever he did\\n with David Geffen and Virgin\\n and basically\\n he bought himself\\n out of the contract.\\n Was it a good decision\\n in hindsight of history?\\n I\\'m not sure.\\n George unquestionably\\n lost the battle but won the war.\\n Because he got the freedom\\n that he craved for.\\n \\'Cause he felt he had\\n to get away.\\n Peace to George Michael.\\n Peace.\\n MICHAEL:\\n I think the whole experience\\n of losing Anselmo,\\n the period of grief,\\n roughly two years,\\n that I didn\\'t write a note\\n of music...\\n And then,\\n the absolute knowledge\\n that the next album\\n I was going to write\\n would be about grief\\n and recovery.\\n Older is my greatest moment.\\n Kindness\\n In your eyes I guess\\n You heard me cry\\n You smiled at me\\n Like Jesus to a child\\n I sat at a keyboard,\\n played a very simple\\n string part,\\n added a very,\\n very gentle guitar part.\\n And my way of making music\\n is very strange.\\n It\\'s very strange.\\n Generally, I put\\n my backing tracks together\\n very simply on keyboards.\\n In this case, I think,\\n I\\'ve added a little guitar.\\n But the moment I think\\n there is something coming,\\n there is something\\n important coming,\\n I shove everybody\\n out of the room, I go in.\\n And then I just sing\\n on repeat, repeat,\\n repeat, repeat.\\n I sing, and I sing,\\n and I sing.\\n This whole total stream\\n of consciousness rubbish\\n that people would laugh\\n their heads off if they heard\\n what I was singing.\\n And then, I sang\\n \"Like Jesus to a Child\".\\n Simple as that.\\n And I thought, \"Oh, my God.\\n That\\'s him.\\n That\\'s him and me.\\n Like Jesus to a child.\"\\n Then I was so excited\\n that I\\'d finally\\n been able to put my feelings\\n about Anselmo into words.\\n And within a week\\n of writing it,\\n I was singing it in front\\n of the Brandenburg Gate,\\n playing my first kind\\n of public tribute\\n to him there.\\n Well, I\\'ve been loved\\n So, I know just\\n What love is\\n And the lover\\n That I kissed\\n Was always by my side...\\n I guess, \"Jesus to a Child\"\\n is just the story of me being\\n rescued from myself\\n by someone\\n with an incredibly good heart.\\n Oh the lover I still miss\\n Was Jesus to a child\\n I just celebrate people\\n who are able to use their joys\\n and their pains\\n to really help people to heal.\\n MICHAEL:\\n I think I wrote the best,\\n most healing piece of music.\\n It was all systems go\\n from that point on.\\n In the absence of security\\n I made my way\\n Into the night\\n Stupid Cupid keeps on\\n Calling me\\n And I see lovin\\'\\n In his eyes\\n I miss my baby\\n For anyone who had a clue\\n about any kind of symbolism,\\n I was coming out.\\n And you know,\\n \"Fast Love\" makes me laugh,\\n because it\\'s all\\n about cruising\\n and covering my pain.\\n Blunting out that pain\\n with fast love.\\n Simple as that.\\n I do believe that we are\\n Practicing the same religion\\n There\\'s not one track\\n on that album\\n that is not about Anselmo,\\n about the risk of AIDS,\\n which was\\n \"Spinning The Wheel\".\\n Watch you spinning\\n That wheel for me\\n You\\'ve got a thing\\n About danger\\n Ain\\'t you getting\\n What you want from me?\\n You\\'ve got a thing\\n About strangers\\n Baby that\\'s what\\n We used to be\\n That\\'s what we used to be\\n You\\'ve got a thing\\n About danger baby\\n I guess the hungry\\n Just can\\'t see\\n One of these days\\n You\\'re going\\n To bring some home to me\\n I believe I\\n was destined to feel\\n that particular pain\\n so that I could do\\n the ultimate with my music\\n in terms of healing.\\n And the number of people\\n who come up to me and say,\\n \"Oh, you don\\'t know how much\\n you helped me withOlder\\n when I lost this person\\n or when I lost that person.\"\\n Give me time\\n And I\\'ll lead you\\n Back to...\\n I remember theUnplugged\\n really, really vividly.\\n Apart from the fact\\n that I felt\\n something magical happened,\\n I knew that everything\\n that came out of my mouth,\\n was going to be in tune,\\n I don\\'t know why.\\n I suppose I wasn\\'t used\\n to playing in small venues\\n and just the fact that I\\n could hear everything I\\n was doing\\n because there wasn\\'t\\n a lot of amplification,\\n I just lost myself\\n in singing that night.\\n She takes the back road\\n And the lane\\n Past the school that has\\n Not changed\\n In all this time\\n She thinks of when the boy\\n Was young\\n All the battles\\n She had won\\n Just to give him life\\n That man\\n She loved that man\\n For all his life\\n And now we meet\\n To take him flowers\\n And only God knows why\\n I came out to my parents\\n the day after Anselmo died.\\n My mother,\\n bless her, wasn\\'t...\\n Wasn\\'t...\\n She wasn\\'t slightly fazed\\n by the gay thing,\\n which she probably\\n worked out years before.\\n She was just devastated\\n that I had gone through\\n a year and a half of terror,\\n you know, without her knowing.\\n Therefore, she couldn\\'t\\n help me in any way.\\n And I think that was really\\n really painful for her.\\n The issue of me being gay\\n was nothing.\\n I wrote a letter that flowed\\n almost as though my hand\\n was moving itself, you know.\\n This letter telling them\\n how much I loved him\\n and how much joy\\n there was for me\\n in my sexuality\\n and not to worry for me\\n and not to feel like\\n I had suffered anything.\\n Trying to, really trying to\\n save my mum from any pain\\n that she thought\\n she could have saved me from.\\n \"Take care, my love,\"\\n He said\\n You have been loved\\n And I\\'m so glad,\\n I\\'m so glad my mom was there.\\n And I\\'m so glad, you know,\\n for the first time ever,\\n and definitely the only time\\n ever on film,\\n I actually said hello\\n to my mom in the audience.\\n Hello, Mum.\\n And it was the last time\\n she ever saw me play.\\n I had about six month\\'s period\\n where things were okay,\\n and I was recording Older.\\n Then I found out\\n that my mother had cancer.\\n I was so spiritually crushed\\n after Mum died,\\n so crushed, and so...\\n Felt so bloody picked on\\n by the gods, you know.\\n For all of my adult life,\\n she was phenomenal,\\n absolutely phenomenal.\\n A terrible, horrible loss.\\n From the day that I found out\\n about my partner\\n to the day that I could say,\\n I actually felt that I was well\\n on the mend from my mother,\\n it was just constant fear.\\n It was either fear of death\\n or fear of the next bereavement,\\n you know?\\n And I just took it\\n very, very badly.\\n Very badly indeed.\\n I\\'ve never felt\\n that kind of depression.\\n I felt it was something\\n different to grief.\\n It was on top of grief\\n because I was grieving\\n for my mother still.\\n But it was something else.\\n It was...\\n I felt like a sportsman\\n that had had a terrible injury\\n in the middle\\n of an incredibly\\n successful career.\\n I\\'m so, so much more aware\\n of how intrinsic to my entire\\n being it is, to be able\\n to create music.\\n Having lost it for three\\n or four years of my life,\\n I really did, I lost the music\\n at the center of me,\\n which was like losing God\\n for me.\\n It really was.\\n It was the darkest,\\n darkest time.\\n But even when\\n I\\'ve lost control,\\n even when I\\'ve really hit\\n rock bottom,\\n I believe that the red line\\n is still there.\\n I\\'d just like to say\\n very genuinely,\\n I am really touched by this.\\n The first half of the \\'90s\\n was pretty crap for me,\\n and 1996 has, kind of,\\n made it all worthwhile.\\n Thank you very much.\\n MAN: I

What do you want?\\n - Hotel de Turistas.\\n - You see?\\n - Oh, thank you.\\n - Good.\\n Welcome.\\n (bell tolling in distance)\\n - Now, here we have the\\n Great Cathedral of Cuzco,\\n the site of the famous bell, Maria Angola,\\n whose tones can be heard from a distance\\n of seven kilometres.\\n The building is also famous\\n for the art treasures it contains.\\n Among them, a canvas\\n attributed to van Dyck.\\n Now, if you'll just follow me.\\n (bell tolling)\\n This edifice was established\\n by the early Spanish fathers\\n in 1595,\\n It survived two major earthquakes.\\n Now, if you'll just step inside here.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n Take over, would you, Senor Fernandez?\\n I've been running errands all day.\\n I think the number-three\\n tour will satisfy 'em.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n (Juan speaking foreign language)\\n - These are knives\\n made of bronze for surgical purposes.\\n They give us an idea of\\n an advanced civilization.\\n As a matter of fact, two\\n famous Peruvian surgeons\\n recently performed an operation\\n using the very same knives\\n for skull surgery.\\n It was a very successful one.\\n These textiles are considered\\n among the finest in the world,\\n including the most perfect\\n ones of the Egyptians.\\n Many great discoveries are\\n the result of purest chance.\\n A native trades the\\n secret to a hidden city\\n for a glass of chicha.\\n A child seeks a lost lamb on a hillside\\n and finds the Rosetta Stone.\\n The earth shakes, as it did in 1950,\\n and opens a secret room,\\n and we have in our hands a stone map\\n showing the way to the tombs\\n of the rulers of Machu Picchu and Cuzco.\\n And now, here you see a fine collection\\n of pots, trays and dishes\\n in different shapes\\n and decorations.\\n - She reminds me of my mother.\\n - Mm, your mother is very pretty.\\n - Yeah.\\n - You're thinking of\\n changing horses in midstream?\\n - Wouldn't you?\\n (woman chuckles)\\n - These big vases named aryballos,\\n for their similarity to the Greek ones,\\n were used in the preparation of chicha.\\n It was found in 1915,\\n in a tomb just outside Cuzco.\\n And now for the piece de resistance.\\n (all gasp)\\n - [Harry] There's a million\\n dollars within reach.\\n - I thought you were all\\n talked out, Mr. Steele.\\n - Not on this subject.\\n (Juan chuckles)\\n - Where did they come from?\\n - Uh, the large relic was a gift\\n from the great Spanish\\n conqueror, Vizarron.\\n This small sunburst is pure Inca.\\n - A sunburst like that,\\n only twice as big, was stolen\\n from the Inca Temple of the\\n Sun nearly four centuries ago.\\n It had 119 pure diamonds,\\n 243 other precious stones,\\n and weighed nearly 30 pounds.\\n Pure gold.\\n It's never been found.\\n There's a legend that the Inca empire\\n was destroyed by the gods\\n because the sunburst disappeared.\\n The Indians believe their\\n empire will be restored\\n if they find the sacred sunburst.\\n This one's big brother.\\n - Is there really such\\n a sunburst somewhere?\\n - Well, if there isn't,\\n archaeologists have dug up half of Peru\\n just to look at some\\n old ruins and mummies.\\n (all laughing)\\n (all chattering)\\n (lively music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - Oh, good evening, Harry.\\n - Good evening, Mr. Winston.\\n - Miss Winston.\\n - Hello.\\n - We, uh, thought we'd\\n like to see some nightlife.\\n Maybe you could help us.\\n - Well, not much to see.\\n Some native dances maybe,\\n if you're interested.\\n - Well, that sounds exciting.\\n - Oh, it is.\\n I can't stand that much excitement myself.\\n Here, go to this place.\\n El Prado.\\n Find a man named Ed Morgan.\\n He'll see that you have a good time.\\n - Ed Morgan.\\n Is he a friend of yours?\\n - Well, don't lend him any money.\\n - We, We thought you might go with us.\\n - I'm meeting a girl.\\n - Oh.\\n We don't want to interfere\\n with your private life.\\n - You won't.\\n - Thanks, Harry.\\n See you tomorrow.\\n - Have a good time.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Please, could you help me?\\n Where is Mr. Harry Steele?\\n - Right by the bar.\\n - Thank you.\\n Mr. Steele?\\n Harry Steele?\\n - Well, does a name really matter?\\n - Yes, because my name's Steele,\\n and I'm bigger than you are.\\n - Oh, I...\\n - You should have stuck around\\n the museum this afternoon.\\n - I didn't know who you were.\\n - [Harry] Now you know.\\n - I called Mr. Morgan.\\n He said you would help me.\\n - Mr. Morgan says a lot of things.\\n How'd you know where to find him?\\n - Nina Costa sent me\\n from the Club Granada in La Paz.\\n I worked for her.\\n Dancing.\\n - Club must have changed its policy.\\n - All I do is dance, Mr. Steele.\\n - Call me Harry.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - Hmm?\\n - He wants to know if you're drinking.\\n - Oh, thank you.\\n A pisco sour in a tall glass.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - What's your name?\\n - Elena.\\n Elena Antonescu.\\n - Mr. Morgan said you're from Europe.\\n He didn't say where.\\n - It's not important.\\n - Like that.\\n How'd you get out, under the fence?\\n - Illegally, yes.\\n - That must have been tough.\\n - They have been trying\\n to get me back ever since.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - That'll be six soles.\\n I'm on a budget.\\n Now, what's your problem?\\n - [Elena] I want to get\\n into the United States.\\n - Why don't you ask me something easy,\\n like a nice murder,\\n or a boatload of penicillin?\\n - All T wish from you is to go north.\\n If I can get to Mexico,\\n I will be that much closer to the States.\\n - Even that might take a little time.\\n - You will help me?\\n - Don't rush me.\\n How'd you get across the Bolivian border?\\n - I got across at Lake Titicaca.\\n - Gave the guards a smile\\n instead of your papers, huh?\\n - I have no papers.\\n - Any particular reason\\n why you left La Paz?\\n - Police.\\n No visible means of support.\\n - They need glasses.\\n (snapping fingers)\\n Order us both another drink.\\n I've been saving up.\\n Hello?\\n Okay.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n Over here.\\n That was Morgan on the phone.\\n There's a report on you from La Paz.\\n Apparently, you're pretty hot cargo.\\n - I must go north.\\n - I know a man who might be\\n able to get you into Ecuador.\\n He has very expensive habits, though.\\n - Without your help,\\n I'm in serious trouble.\\n - I'm not cheap, either.\\n - I know I can depend on you.\\n - Maybe you don't hear good.\\n How much money have you got?\\n - About $50.\\n - You're still in trouble.\\n - But it's all the money I have.\\n - That's not money.\\n That's tips.\\n It'd cost me that much\\n just to get an appointment with this guy.\\n I'm sorry, but the wheels\\n just don't turn for 50 bucks.\\n - You won't help me?\\n - I'm not your Uncle Harry.\\n It's a very good act.\\n Very good indeed.\\n - It usually works.\\n - I've seen so many women cry,\\n it doesn't impress me anymore.\\n (Elena sobbing)\\n I got you a room.\\n That's the most I can do for you,\\n unless you want a guided tour of Cuzco.\\n You can stay here a few days anyway.\\n - Thank you.\\n It's no use.\\n He'll come after me.\\n - Who will?\\n - The Romanian Council.\\n He flew to La Paz to get me.\\n They'll do anything to\\n get their refugee back\\n behind the Iron Curtain.\\n He follow me.\\n - Well, there aren't any\\n passenger flights for Friday.\\n - He flies a plane himself.\\n - Flies his own plane?\\n This guy from the embassy?\\n Large or small?\\n - Small, I think.\\n Why?\\n - It's kind of a hobby of mine.\\n Planes.\\n He's in La Paz, you said.\\n What's his name?\\n - Marcu.\\n Anton Marcu.\\n - You get some sleep.\\n I'll see you later.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n My name's Steele.\\n Harry Steele.\\n - What do you want?\\n - You left your key\\n in the lock.\\n I thought maybe you were\\n looking for company.\\n - No.\\n - Well, the least you could say is maybe.\\n - I said no.\\n - I came to tell you something.\\n You won't like it.\\n - The police.\\n They know where I am?\\n - Worse than that.\\n This guy Marcu knows.\\n - How could he find out?\\n - Oh, some heel must have told him.\\n Hey, wait.\\n Not so fast.\\n He can't get here till tomorrow.\\n Besides, I want you here when he comes.\\n - I am beginning to wonder\\n about you, Mr. Steele.\\n You will forgive me,\\n but I'm very suspicious.\\n - No one trusts me.\\n - Marcu.\\n Why is he important to you?\\n - Because he's coming by plane.\\n A nice private plane.\\n - To get me, to take me back if I'm here.\\n - I guess I'll have to be honest with you.\\n - It would be a nice change.\\n - I hate to tell the truth,\\n but I want that plane.\\n I want it so bad, I can taste it.\\n - How does that concern me?\\n - You're my bait.\\n When this guy gets here, I\\n dangle you in front of him\\n till I get my hooks in that plane.\\n - You want me to help you?\\n Mm-hmm.\\n I know what I do for you.\\n What do you do for me?\\n - When I leave, you go with me.\\n - Mexico?\\n - Ecuador.\\n - Mexico.\\n - Not right away, though.\\n Something else I have to do first.\\n - All right, I will wait for the plane.\\n How can we get it from him?\\n - All we need are the keys.\\n You could get 'em easily.\\n - How?\\n - He'll have 'em in his pants pocket.\\n Okay.\\n I'll think of something else.\\n - Mr. Steele.\\n You told Marcu I was here, Mr. Steele?\\n - Call me Harry.\\n (Charlie speaking\\n foreign language over pa)\\n - Clear runway for plane now landing.\\n Looks like the plane\\n you've been waiting for.\\n - It is.\\n A friend of mine.\\n I talked to him on the phone last night.\\n He asked me to order\\n a load of gas for him.\\n - Okay.\\n Who shall I charge it to?\\n - Masca.\\n Marcu.\\n M-A-R-C-U.\\n He wanted high test.\\n - Nothing but the best.\\n (engine whirring)\\n - Welcome to Cuzco, the\\n city of light, Mr. Marcu.\\n - Oh, you're the man who called me.\\n - Steele's the name.\\n Harry Steele.\\n - The young lady we talked about-\\n - I convinced her she ought\\n to stay and talk to you.\\n - You told her I was coming\\n and she did not run away?\\n - I sold her a bill of goods.\\n Told her I'd help her\\n escape, stuff like that.\\n - You're very intelligent, Mister-\\n - Call me Harry.\\n - I won't need your name.\\n Just tell me where she is.\\n - I hate to seem sordid\\n and commercial about this,\\n but my piggy bank's seen better days.\\n Pengos, zlotys, whatever\\n you use in Romania.\\n - Oh, you want your money?\\n - Uh-huh.\\n - I have it right here.\\n Where is she?\\n - When I have it right here,\\n we'll go find her.\\n - Get my bag.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - And if I don't?\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n You do not give me much choice.\\n (Anton speaking foreign language)\\n If I go back with you,\\n what will happen to me?\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - Do you have to speak English?\\n - She's just being polite.\\n She doesn't want me to get bored.\\n I'm not bored.\\n Hello, Mrs. Winston.\\n - I said, what will happen to me?\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n If I go with you, I will\\n never see the light again.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - I have friends.\\n Nothing will happen to me here.\\n - Him?\\n You think he will help you?\\n I can buy him like potatoes.\\n You.\\n Get me a drink.\\n - Sure.\\n Doing things for you is a pleasure.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - That guy you're with, you'll\\n put him out with that, Harry.\\n - He's healthier than he looks.\\n - Doesn't he know better in this altitude?\\n - I'm teaching him.\\n - I want,\\n I want to talk to you.\\n - No.\\n - You don't treat me right.\\n - That worries me, Ed.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n Don't do that.\\n - Elena-\\n - You, Slav.\\n I said don't do that.\\n - Ow.\\n - Is it necessary to get angry?\\n - Who's angry?\\n If I was angry, I might have\\n done something like this.\\n (Anton groans)\\n I'm so impatient.\\n He must have left the keys in his jacket.\\n Manuel.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n His room is 218.\\n Put him in a cool, dark place.\\n - It is the altitude.\\n - Very bad, the altitude.\\n (people laughing)\\n - What now?\\n - Your room is 220.\\n It's right next to his and\\n there's a balcony in between.\\n - You want me to get the keys?\\n Why not you?\\n - He wakes up and finds you in his room,\\n he won't be the one to do the yelling.\\n - I want to talk to you, Harry.\\n - I don't want to talk to you.\\n - About that stone I know you've got.\\n - Why don't you shave once in a while?\\n - I'll buy it from you.\\n Pay you good for it.\\n Enough to get you home.\\n - Why, you poor little\\n thing, you're trembling.\\n - Until now I took it easy.\\n Now it's different.\\n I want that stone.\\n - Come and get it.\\n - I won't forget this, Harry.\\n - I don't think you will at that.\\n (lively music)\\n - He didn't even move.\\n - We'll have to get our luggage.\\n Give me the keys.\\n - Not until we're on the plane.\\n - I thought you were just beginning\\n to trust me, Miss Antonescu.\\n - Call me Elena.\\n (Harry speaking foreign language)\\n (men chattering in\\n speaking foreign language)\\n - I'll get them away from here.\\n As soon as they leave,\\n run to the plane, get on board\\n and unlock the panel boards.\\n You got that?\\n (men speaking foreign language)\\n (glass shatters)\\n (men speaking foreign language)\\n (panel clanking)\\n (men chattering in foreign language)\\n (engine sputtering)\\n (engine starts)\\n (man speaking foreign language)\\n (siren blaring)\\n (guns firing)\\n Good old Charlie.\\n Got enough gas for eight hours.\\n - Where are we?\\n - About 10 miles across that\\n river is where we're headed.\\n - Why do we stop here?\\n I thought we keep on going.\\n - That's what they think back in Cuzco.\\n They know exactly how far we'd go\\n on eight hours' worth of gas.\\n They'll have every field\\n pinpointed and be waiting for us.\\n Only we won't be there.\\n - Where will we be?\\n - Look,\\n don't start giving me a bad time.\\n I'm here for a reason.\\n You can either change your clothes\\n and come along with me or\\n start walking back, that way.\\n - I have the right to ask questions.\\n - Sure.\\n Only don't do it.\\n It annoys me.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Ow!\\n - Wear heavier socks tomorrow.\\n - I think I hate you.\\n You said you'd take me to Mexico.\\n - I didn't say when.\\n - Where are we going, then?\\n - You ever hear of Machu Picchu?\\n - No.\\n - It's an ancient city of the Incas.\\n It was lost for over 1000 years.\\n You'll see it tomorrow.\\n - Why are you so anxious\\n to get this place?\\n - It's out of the high-rent district.\\n - I want to go to Mexico.\\n You promised.\\n - Quit nagging.\\n - Harry.\\n - Yeah?\\n - I'm cold.\\n - Yeah.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Oh!\\n Where are you from, Harry?\\n - California.\\n - Oh, California.\\n I know about California.\\n Everything.\\n All the apples come from there.\\n - Sure, that's it, California.\\n That's where they come from, all right.\\n And Florida.\\n Lots of apples.\\n - You see?\\n I know everything about the United States.\\n Ask me anything.\\n - Oh.\\n Who cut down the cherry tree?\\n - Abraham Lincoln.\\n - I didn't think you'd know.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n Maybe I should have shaved.\\n - I like you this way.\\n - I'm getting my message, huh?\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - And tomorrow we go back to the plane\\n and to Mexico,\\n won't\\n we?\\n - Let's talk about that tomorrow.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n You're about through.\\n - Can't breathe.\\n - Well, the air is still\\n pretty thin, even here.\\n We're about 8,000 feet.\\n - This place we are going-\\n - Machu Picchu.\\n - Is it 'cause there is\\n someone there who knows you?\\n - There won't be anyone there.\\n A few Indians, maybe.\\n It's not a summer resort.\\n Not many people go to Machu Picchu.\\n - I could do without it, myself.\\n (Elena gasps)\\n - That'll keep you going for a while.\\n You want me to carry\\n you the rest of the way?\\n - No.\\n - I'm glad you said that.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n There it is.\\n Machu Picchu,\\n the lost city of the Incas.\\n Tents.\\n Someone here ahead of us.\\n - Perhaps it's only some visitors.\\n - Told you, no one comes\\n here without a reason.\\n The only reason is to dig.\\n I don't like the competition.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (boy speaking foreign language)\\n Some sort of an archaeological expedition.\\n Let's get our stories straight.\\n We ran out of gas in\\n the plane, understand?\\n We want gas.\\n - And you and I, what\\n are we to each other?\\n Brother and sister?\\n - Nobody'd believe that, including me.\\n You hired me to pilot your plane.\\n Got that?\\n What happened to you?\\n - I fell.\\n - Got to watch your feet up here.\\n It's two miles straight down.\\n (Harry speaking foreign language)\\n - Not right away.\\n You have come at a very important time.\\n - You speak English.\\n I learned to at the University of Cuzco.\\n - What's going on down there?\\n - They're bringing out the Mama Cuna,\\n what you call a high priestess.\\n We found her mummy this morning.\\n - I don't believe in\\n disturbing the dead myself.\\n Found any treasure?\\n - Not yet.\\n But we're hoping to find the\\n tomb of our last Inca chief.\\n - People have been looking for\\n Manco's tomb for a long time.\\n - You know his name?\\n - But not yours.\\n - My name is Pachacutec.\\n And you?\\n - Call me Harry.\\n - If you would wait here, please.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n Dr. Moore head.\\n Dr. Moore head.\\n - Some people have come.\\n - People?\\n - Dr. Livingston, I presume?\\n - Moore head is my name.\\n We don't have a Livingston\\n with our expedition.\\n Oh.\\n Sort of a joke.\\n That's very amusing.\\n - My name's Steele.\\n Harry Steele.\\n This is Miss Elena Antonescu.\\n We came by plane.\\n - Mr. Steele is my pilot.\\n - We got off-course and run\\n out of gas about 10 miles back.\\n Some natives told us you\\n were up here, so we came up.\\n - We need gasoline.\\n - I'm sorry. We don't have any.\\n No use for it, I'm afraid.\\n - We could shortwave Tampu,\\n that's our supply base,\\n and have some fuel sent\\n in by pack train.\\n - You have a shortwave set.\\n - [Dr. Moorhead] Even so,\\n it would take a few days.\\n - We don't mind waiting.\\n - All right.\\n Oh, this is Mr. Lang, my assistant.\\n Miss Antonescu and Mr. Steele.\\n - [Both] How do you do?\\n - And this is Colonel Cardoza.\\n You'll meet the others later.\\n We've just made some very\\n important discoveries.\\n - There are lots of you, aren't there?\\n - We represent three\\n museums and universities.\\n New York, Mexico City and Lima.\\n Colonel Cardoza represents\\n the Peruvian government.\\n It's his job to see that we\\n don't appropriate any souvenirs.\\n - The rules are only for\\n scientists, senorita.\\n For you, the entire city is yours.\\n - Thank you.\\n I'll take it with me when we leave.\\n - You've hurt yourself.\\n - Oh, it's only a scratch.\\n Nothing serious.\\n - Take her to the first-aid tent.\\n I'll be there in a minute.\\n - Certainly, Dr. Moore head.\\n Would you like to be carried?\\n - Oh, it's not so bad.\\n - Oh, I'm sorry.\\n - Miss Antonescu is-\\n - Very attractive.\\n - My colleagues and I don't\\n see many attractive women\\n up here.\\n - Your assistant seems to\\n be making up for lost time.\\n Don't worry, I just drive her aeroplane.\\n If you can dig up a place for me to stay,\\n I'd like to scrape myself off.\\n - I think there's a cot in the radio tent.\\n I will show you.\\n We dine at sundown, about an hour.\\n I hope we can make your\\n stay here a pleasant one.\\n - Don't worry.\\n I plan to enjoy myself.\\n - I don't want to be any trouble.\\n - No, no, not at all.\\n Oh, is it all right to give\\n her the temple, Doctor?\\n - Very appropriate.\\n Oh, have you met Kori-Tica,\\n my laboratory assistant?\\n Miss Antonescu.\\n How were you hurt?\\n - I stumbled.\\n I fell against the rock.\\n - That's not so bad, then.\\n As long as you didn't touch the earth.\\n The bacteria at this\\n altitude are quite dangerous.\\n Well, we'll have a look\\n and see what we shall see.\\n Oh, that's enough.\\n More than enough.\\n - You want to get at me, no?\\n - Only to a limited extent.\\n I don't wish to embarrass you.\\n - I'm not.\\n You're a doctor.\\n - [Dr. Moore head] I'm\\n not a medical doctor.\\n A doctor in arts and sciences.\\n - Oh, that is different?\\n - As a rule, yes quite different.\\n - It's enough?\\n - Uh, disinfectant.\\n - Iodine?\\n Lots of iodine?\\n - No something gentle.\\n - No iodine?\\n - Oh.\\n - Iodine.\\n - Your palace is ready, Princess.\\n If you'll just come this way,\\n - Kori-Tica will show her where it is.\\n - Thank you for this.\\n - Thank you.\\n I mean, you're welcome.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - I'm sorry.\\n I cannot understand you.\\n - She says get in, it is a bath.\\n - It's so small!\\n - You stand in it straight up.\\n Do you understand?\\n - Oh, yes.\\n Thank you.\\n You speak English very well.\\n - So do you.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - What does she say?\\n - She says you are beautiful.\\n - Oh!\\n Go away.\\n I'm taking a bath.\\n - Cleanliness is next to godliness.\\n - You peeping Joe.\\n - You left your window open.\\n All the neighbours are complaining.\\n - How long have you been there?\\n - Hours and hours.\\n - Liar.\\n You always lie.\\n Now go away.\\n - Okay.\\n You'll never make any\\n friends with that attitude.\\n By the way, she's right.\\n You really are (speaks foreign language).\\n That means white as a dead fish.\\n - Oh!\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - Not bad.\\n The Incans never looked that good.\\n Pachacutec.\\n - Yes?\\n - Tell your sister 1\\n understand Quechua very well.\\n - You are offended?\\n - No.\\n She's very honest.\\n I like her.\\n - What was all that about?\\n - She said I had a grey face.\\n It's an expression the Indians use\\n for someone not to be trusted.\\n A liar, a cheat.\\n Or a thief.\\n Maybe it's beginning to show.\\n What do you think?\\n Never mind.\\n Not if it takes that long.\\n Anyway, I know what I am,\\n and I can live with it.\\n - What are you going to do here, Harry?\\n - I'm going to get rich.\\n Quick.\\n - How?\\n - That tomb they just started to open.\\n Inside it, there's a hunk of\\n gold with 119 pure diamonds\\n and 243 other precious stones.\\n That's for me.\\n - You are going to steal it?\\n With all these people watching?\\n - I have an advantage.\\n I know it's there.\\n And I know exactly where.\\n They don't.\\n - Suppose I tell them about you.\\n - You won't.\\n Not if you don't want to\\n get sent back to Europe\\n for your troubles.\\n Your only way out of Peru is with me.\\n The only way I can get the\\n sunburst out is with the plane.\\n That's why I needed it.\\n I never needed you.\\n - Why didn't you leave me in the jungle?\\n - I gave it some thought.\\n - You have forgotten something.\\n - Have I?\\n - The radio.\\n If they call in anyplace,\\n there will be information about us.\\n You forgot about that.\\n - You know,\\n funny thing, they tried using the radio\\n just a little while ago.\\n Didn't work.\\n Just lucky, I guess.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (lively music)\\n - [Dr. Moorhead] The In can civilization\\n was beginning to disappear\\n when these objects were made.\\n - What about Manco's tomb?\\n Do you expect to find the sunburst?\\n - You know about the sunburst?\\n - A little.\\n Everyone knows a little about it.\\n - The sunburst was a legendary\\n treasure of the Incas.\\n - I have heard about it.\\n - You said legendary.\\n - I don't believe it exists.\\n I imagine it has long since\\n been melted down and destroyed.\\n In archaeology, we soon\\n learn that objects made\\n of ordinary metal\\n will survive the years and all of history.\\n Objects made of gold don't\\n survive those who make them.\\n - The moral being that\\n gold's worth melting.\\n - Depends on how you\\n look at it, Mr. Steele.\\n - Call me Harry.\\n (lively music)\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - With your permission.\\n - Of course.\\n Kori-Tica has great pride in her race.\\n She believes in the ancient customs.\\n Sundown, she obeys the Inca laws.\\n - The food has something to do with it?\\n - It's an offering to the Mama Cuna.\\n - [Elena] I would love to see it.\\n - Certainly.\\n Harry?\\n (cymbal crashes)\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (Kori-Tica vocalising)\\n The legend is that Inti's\\n daughter sang this song\\n when she and the virgins\\n of the temple were claimed\\n by the sun.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n (Kori-Tica vocalising)\\n (lively music)\\n - They seem very excited\\n and happy, these people.\\n - Tomorrow there will\\n be thousands of them.\\n Finding the Mama Cuna is a\\n great event in their lives.\\n - And yours.\\n - I'm used to finding things.\\n Beautiful things in strange surroundings.\\n - You are very quiet man.\\n You make me feel comfortable.\\n - I wish I felt comfortable.\\n (mysterious orchestral music)\\n I, uh, I hope you're comfortable here.\\n - Very.\\n - If there's anything we can do for you-\\n - No, thank you.\\n - You're sure?\\n - Yes, thank you.\\n - You're welcome.\\n Well, oh, how's the shoulder?\\n - Oh, fine.\\n - No pain or anything?\\n - You did a good job.\\n You, you have a very gentle touch.\\n - Archaeologists have to be gentle.\\n Things crumble into dust, you know.\\n - I won't crumble for\\n many years yet. (chuckles)\\n - I didn't mean you.\\n - I know.\\n Good night.\\n - Good night.\\n - I like you, Dr. Moore head.\\n I like you very much.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Oh, there you are.\\n I've been looking all over for you.\\n Now, tell me, Doctor,\\n what's your opinion of\\n the Inca civilization\\n now that you've had an\\n opportunity of study?\\n (grand orchestral music)\\n (horns blowing)\\n How did you get here?\\n - Followed my nose, boy.\\n Followed my nose.\\n - Well, follow it right back home again.\\n - Oh, no.\\n Before it was all in fun.\\n This is business, Harry.\\n I'm here and I'm staying.\\n - Okay, Ed.\\n I know when I've had it.\\n Business is business.\\n If you were smart enough\\n to figure out where I went,\\n you're smart enough to be a\\n big help to me in the clutch.\\n - That's very nice of you, Harry.\\n This what you're looking for?\\n You and me with our little business.\\n We just had a meeting\\n and we elected a new\\n chairman of the board.\\n These six votes are for me.\\n Sit down, over there.\\n - Anybody else know where I went?\\n - Not even looking for you.\\n Make you feel better?\\n - Why aren't they looking for me?\\n - The guy you stole the plane from\\n didn't make any complaint.\\n - Didn't want word to get\\n back home that he'd goofed.\\n - That's the way it figures.\\n Anyhow, you're in the\\n clear, except with me.\\n - What about you?\\n - Oh, I'm way ahead now.\\n Before I was behind you,\\n but now I'm way ahead.\\n To start with, hand over that rock.\\n - What if I say no?\\n - Harry, I'm so mad at you,\\n I could put a big hole in your head,\\n talk my way out of it afterwards.\\n With your record, I might just make it.\\n Now come with it.\\n - What now?\\n - Now we'll talk.\\n That expedition,\\n I heard about it in Cuzco after you left.\\n How far have they got with the digging?\\n - They're about to enter the main tomb.\\n - Manco's tomb?\\n - Looks that way.\\n - The sunburst is there?\\n - That's what it says on the stone.\\n - That's nice.\\n Oh, that's very nice.\\n - And while your feelings\\n are good, what about us?\\n You and me.\\n - 50-50, down the middle.\\n We get the sunburst and we\\n go out of here together.\\n When we get to a human place,\\n we divide it up, down the middle.\\n - (laughing) I got a mental image\\n of you giving me a square shake.\\n - If you don't trust\\n me, don't sleep nights.\\n - What about the girl?\\n - I like girls.\\n This one, what I saw of her,\\n could wind up with all I've got\\n if she works at it.\\n - You're pretty crummy, Ed.\\n - And you, Harry, you're all right, huh?\\n - Come on.\\n Better meet people while\\n I figure out a good reason\\n for an ape like you being here.\\n - I'll remember you, Harry.\\n You and your mouth.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Dr. Moore head.\\n - Hmm?\\n - This is Ed Morgan, a friend of mine.\\n This is Dr. Moore head, the\\n head of the expedition here.\\n - Nice little place you got here, Doc.\\n - Mr. Morgan brought up the gasoline\\n I needed from Cuzco.\\n And I was able to get out a\\n message on the plane radio\\n just before we landed.\\n I didn't know whether\\n anybody heard it or not.\\n - I got word of it.\\n Decided to bring the gas myself.\\n Isn't anything I wouldn't\\n do for the big fella.\\n - How did you know we were up here?\\n - Probably met the runner\\n we sent down the river.\\n - That's just what happened, Doc.\\n Met the little ol' runner.\\n He told me my buddy was here and needed me\\n and here I am.\\n That's friendship.\\n - One friend like Morgan\\n here is all a man needs.\\n More?\\n (Ed chuckles)\\n - I will have to find a\\n place for you to stay.\\n - Oh, I I'll bunk in with my buddy.\\n We hate to be separated.\\n Don't we, Harry?\\n - I can hardly sleep nights.\\n By the way, Doctor, we'll be leaving soon,\\n but I thought as long as we were up here,\\n I might do a little hunting.\\n Thought you might lend me a rifle.\\n - Oh, we're up too high.\\n There's no game around here.\\n - I'll find something to shoot at.\\n - [Dr. Moorhead] We\\n don't have any firearms.\\n No use for them.\\n - Too bad.\\n Well, that's that.\\n We'll go shooting some other time, maybe.\\n - I can't wait.\\n - Dr. Moore head, Dr. Menzes would like you\\n and Colonel Cardoza to\\n meet him at the main tomb.\\n - Oh, yes.\\n Excuse me.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - Do you mind if I came with, Doc?\\n I won't get in your way.\\n Just a quiet little mouse, that's me.\\n - If you're interested.\\n - Interested?\\n I've been a lover of art from way back.\\n Spend all my time in the museum,\\n if I could.\\n - That Morgan, what is he doing here?\\n - You know he's doing.\\n - You're bad enough.\\n But he's something special.\\n - That's funny.\\n He likes you.\\n - Harry, before I didn't ask a favour.\\n But I ask now.\\n Why don't we leave, you and I, right away?\\n - And miss all the native dances?\\n - I won't ask again.\\n Whatever happens now, it's your affair.\\n - The doc's a nice guy, isn't he?\\n Kind of polite, very gentle.\\n I notice he's all charged up about you,\\n in a kind of \\\"Yes, ma'am,\\n no, ma'am\\\" sort of way.\\n Wouldn't surprise me\\n a bit if you got a bid\\n to marry the guy.\\n You wouldn't think of anything else.\\n That way, you'd get to\\n the States, all right.\\n Maybe not New York.\\n The doc's from Boston.\\n I think you'd like Boston.\\n All you'd have to do is\\n stay here when I leave.\\n What could be nicer?\\n (light orchestral music)\\n A girl like you,\\n you're made for somebody like me\\n and you know it.\\n So just keep the doc happy\\n till we're ready to move out.\\n - I can do without you.\\n You know why?\\n In my country,\\n when you want to know what\\n kind of man a boy would be,\\n you look at his father.\\n Morgan could be your father.\\n I can see him in your eyes.\\n One day, you will not be Harry anymore.\\n You will be him.\\n - I'm too tall to make a good Morgan.\\n - For a tall man, you are\\n the smallest man I ever met.\\n (dramatic orchestral music)\\n - [Ed] You know how to read this?\\n - Don't you?\\n - Oh, sure, read it like a book.\\n What I want to know is how you figure it.\\n - Well, you've got the stone.\\n Looks like I'll have to depend on you.\\n - Yup.\\n That's the way it's gonna be.\\n Leave everything to your old buddy.\\n Okay, buddy?\\n - Sure.\\n You're my buddy.\\n - (chuckles) It's getting dark.\\n That's the way I like it.\\n I don't know why, but I\\n always move around better\\n when it's dark.\\n I come to life.\\n - Like a bat.\\n - Go easy, Harry.\\n I'm trying hard to like you.\\n - Why?\\n - Okay, let it go.\\n Might be important later.\\n Maybe later you'll wish I liked you.\\n - I'll let you know.\\n - Sure am glad it's getting dark.\\n Nobody ever made a buck in daylight.\\n We'll make plenty on this.\\n I've been hearing about\\n that sunburst 14 years now.\\n You know, we'll sit\\n around and pick it over\\n like a roast chicken.\\n A piece for you and a piece for me.\\n Huh?\\n What about that?\\n Man, I wish we could get\\n in that tomb tonight.\\n What are you staring at?\\n - Sort of a mirror.\\n - Huh?\\n Hey, you're coming all unglued.\\n There ain't no mirror in here.\\n Getting through to ya, huh?\\n Thinking about that sunburst,\\n how it feels holding it in your hands.\\n One million dollars.\\n Think about it, Harry.\\n One million dollars right in your hand.\\n Makes me shake just to think of it.\\n - It's only money.\\n - (chuckles) \\\"Only,\\\" he says,\\n and I can't stop shaking.\\n It's waiting around,\\n standing, waiting around.\\n I don't know ho you can\\n lay around like you do.\\n - I'm thinking.\\n - Think on your feet, like I do.\\n - It's better if I lie down.\\n That way, I won't throw up.\\n (dramatic orchestral music)\\n (singing in foreign language)\\n (Kori-Tica vocalising)\\n (singing in foreign language)\\n (lively music)\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - Hello.\\n I thought perhaps I might\\n find Kori-Tica here.\\n I wanted to ask her\\n advice about something.\\n - She's gone, but perhaps\\n I could give you advice.\\n - I wouldn't be surprised.\\n It's about you.\\n - What advice can I give you?\\n - I'll get to it later.\\n You know what this is?\\n It's called the Intihuatana,\\n the place where the sun is tied.\\n It's in such a position that\\n once a year the sun strikes it\\n exactly in the centre.\\n The Mama Cuna used to hide\\n the jewel led sunburst,\\n and when the sun touched\\n the centre of the stone,\\n she'd hold the sunburst aloft\\n as a symbol that the sun was\\n again the captive of the Incas.\\n Will you marry me?\\n - What did you say?\\n - I'm not very good at this.\\n I mean, proposing.\\n That's what I wanted advice about.\\n - But you don't know me.\\n - That's not an answer.\\n - I am, I'm not very nice.\\n You know where I worked\\n before I came here?\\n A place in La Paz called the Club Granada.\\n Downstairs, there is a band\\n and some tired entertainers.\\n I don't like climbing stairs.\\n - Neither do 1.\\n - You don't listen to me.\\n Listen.\\n For two years, nearly three,\\n I've been trying to get\\n to the United States.\\n And I tell you, there is nothing\\n a woman can do about that\\n without help from a man.\\n And I have no money to pay for help.\\n Now you are listening?\\n - Yes.\\n But it doesn't change anything.\\n Not with me.\\n - You are crazy.\\n - No, just determined.\\n I've wasted too much time.\\n I suddenly realised that\\n the first time I met you.\\n This is important to me.\\n I know it's quick, but it's important.\\n You want to get to the United States.\\n Come with me as my wife.\\n - You'll take me to New York?\\n - Anywhere you like.\\n - California, maybe.\\n Where they have all the apples.\\n - (chuckling) You're thinking of oranges.\\n -Tam?\\n - California's famous for oranges.\\n - Could I ask you something?\\n Something important?\\n Who cut down the cherry tree?\\n - George Washington.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n It looks like the main tomb.\\n (man coughing)\\n We'll need dust masks.\\n Only members of the expedition\\n will be allowed to enter the tomb.\\n All others must wait outside.\\n - Hey, what's the idea?\\n We got as much right in there as anybody.\\n Tell him, Harry.\\n - You tell him, loudmouth.\\n - Huh?\\n Oh, all right, I, I got a little excited.\\n Never mind.\\n - Let me have the light.\\n - [Cardoza] Look.\\n The sunburst.\\n - It's carved out of the stone.\\n So much for the legend\\n of the golden sunburst.\\n - The legend never said it was gold.\\n And now we know why.\\n I never believed in it, myself.\\n - I did.\\n My people did.\\n No, there's no mistake.\\n That is not the true sunburst.\\n - Dr. Perez, come and look at this.\\n You ever seen anything like that before?\\n That insert.\\n Looks like it's made out of quartz.\\n (man speaking foreign language)\\n - What's he saying?\\n - They've opened the tomb.\\n It's Manco's, all right.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n Something about a sunburst.\\n (speaking foreign language)\\n - What's all that?\\n What about the sunburst?\\n - This is gonna be sort of a\\n slug in the belly for you, Ed.\\n They found the sunburst, all right.\\n - Right, then they've\\n saved us the trouble.\\n We'll take it away from them.\\n - Only the trouble is,\\n it isn't worth taking.\\n - Huh?\\n - Made out of stone.\\n - What?\\n - You know.\\n - Don't be sad.\\n - We have waited many hundreds of years\\n for the golden sun to be found.\\n The legend says that only when it is\\n taken back to the Temple of the Sun,\\n only then will the people\\n of the Inca be great again.\\n (light orchestral music)\\n - There's no place to hide up here.\\n You might as well talk to me now.\\n - There is nothing to talk about.\\n - Let's start with the sunburst.\\n - It's only a stone.\\n That must be a bitter\\n thing for you, after coming\\n all this way.\\n - I adjust to things very quickly.\\n Anyway, maybe I've already found something\\n to take its place.\\n That's what I want to know.\\n - You mean me?\\n - That's what I mean.\\n - Tell me something.\\n If their sunburst was\\n gold instead of stone,\\n would you steal it?\\n - I tried to quit smoking once.\\n It didn't work.\\n A habit's a tough thing to break.\\n - You would steal it.\\n That's what you really want, Harry.\\n That kind of excitement.\\n Not me.\\n - Well, I'll be leaving in the morning.\\n - Goodbye.\\n - You're staying here, then?\\n Moore head?\\n - He knows the truth about me.\\n I told him.\\n He wants to marry me.\\n - Well, I admire his taste.\\n If you're around when I\\n shove off in the morning,\\n wave goodbye to me.\\n -

Sit down, please. My name is Miss Clayton,\\n and I'm your new teacher. And since today's\\n our first day together, I think we should get\\n to know one another. So I'm gonna ask each\\n of you to tell us about\\n your summer vacation. Who wants to start? What's your name? Priscilla Johnson. You want to tell us about\\n your vacation, Priscilla? I got the measles. Oh, the measles.\\n That's too bad. Was that at the beginning\\n of vacation or the end? The beginning. Well, good. Then you had\\n all of August to rest up. What did you do in August? I got the mumps. You didn't. I did.\\n But it was okay. It was a neat vacation\\n with lots of presents. And everyone\\n was very nice to me. Oh, good. Except Daddy got nervous\\n when he got the mumps. (LAUGHING) But aside from that,\\n it was great. Is that all? Isn't that enough? Sure. Yes. Thanks, Priscilla. And what's your name? Elliot Field. Go ahead, Elliot.\\n We're listening. I went to summer camp. Okay. What'd you do\\n at summer camp? We threw cottage cheese\\n at each other. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) And then what? Ketchup. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) And aside from having\\n food fights, did you\\n do anything interesting? No, but that\\n was interesting. Yes, it was.\\n Thank you, Elliot. And let's see.\\n What's your name? Marci Campbell. Tell us about\\n your vacation, Marci. Well, during my vacation,\\n my brother lost his job, my mom almost\\n lost her mind and my stepfather\\n was murdered\\n by his twin brother. What kind of story\\n is that, Marci? It's not a story.\\n It's the truth. It happened in Buzzsaw. That's a little\\n town up north. My stepfather\\n was the mayor. I don't remember\\n any story about a mayor being murdered\\n by his twin brother. Okay, Marci, go ahead.\\n Tell your story,\\n we're listening. It was a dark night. Actually, it was a dark\\n and stormy night. A big truck came to my\\n stepfather's lumberyard. A very big truck. And in the truck\\n was a killer. His name\\n was Matt Skearns and he was very tall\\n like my stepfather and very ugly\\n like my stepfather. And he couldn't see\\n without his glasses,\\n like my stepfather. But that was normal, because he was\\n his twin brother. Matt Skearns had come bak\\n to town to get his reven. He'd been in jail for 15 yeas\\n for a crime he didn't commit, so you can imagine\\n how mad he was. (SCREAMING) Matt had an accomplice,\\n Virgil, a man he'd met in prison. Virgil was mean too,\\n but not as mean as Mat. Yo, four eyes.\\n You're late, four eyes. Don't call me that. So, how are the boys\\n in the joint? They don't miss me\\n and they sure as hell\\n don't miss you. (SCOFFS) Now here's\\n the phone number. And the name is Van Der Haven.\\n Mayor Van Der Haven. Good luck.\\n I'll meet you\\n tomorrow night. MARCI: I couldn't sleep\\n because of the storm, so I was relaxing\\n and watching a funny\\n movie on TV when the phone rang. (PHONE RINGING) (BARKS) (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Hello? (CLEARS THROAT) Mayor Van Der Haven? Who's calling?\\n Who is this? Hiya, Petey.\\n (CHUCKLES) Ah, hold on. Matt, how nice\\n to hear from you\\n after all these years. I want $150,000,\\n tomorrow, at your lumberyard! $150,000? Okay, okay. You'll get your goddamn\\n money, you little shit! Just keep your end\\n of the bargain. If I ever see\\n or hear from you again, I'll personally\\n kill you! Understand? I'll kill you! (THUD) MARCI: That night I discovered\\n that my stepfather, who everybody thought was\\n so honest and so respectab, wasn't the man\\n he pretended to be. (THUNDER CLAPS) That night I discovered tht\\n my stepfather was a crimin. Wow. Are you watching too many\\n horror movies, Marci? No, why? Well, one thing's\\n for sure. You have\\n a very active imagination. This isn't imagination.\\n It's the truth. Are there\\n any comments? Yes? It may be too soon to judge,\\n but I have to say\\n I'm really not convinced. It's so overstated,\\n so melodramatic. I'm sorry, Julius,\\n I disagree. So far,\\n it works for me. It's the most outrageous\\n summer vacation I've\\n heard in years. Should I go on? ALL: Yeah! (CHUCKLES)\\n Go ahead, Marci. I needed help.\\n I needed it fast. Only one person\\n to turn to. My big brother, Bill. Book on Echo\\n Tech, please. A.R.V. put in an order\\n for 200,000 at 26. Tell 'em it's gonna\\n get done at 75\\n with or without 'em. All right.\\n Odds for a hundred. Damn, every time.\\n Evens for 200. Do you read minds? It's a question of\\n reorientation, Steve. I know what you're\\n gonna do before you know\\n what you're gonna do. Jerry Beck had a\\n heart attack last night. My God,\\n he's only 36. 34. No time\\n for condolences. You're taking over\\n Daisy Cellular deal. Background,\\n two days ago, Daisy's C.O.\\n Leonard Hathaway dropped dead. Controlling stocks slipped\\n into hands of Julie Holland,\\n niece, must sell. Jerry was to meet today. Decided to have\\n heart attack instead. Such poor judgment\\n will cost Jerry. You will take this meeting. How much me offer? 160 million ceiling. I want it bad.\\n Really bad. Watch out. Travis of\\n Travis, Jacoby and Travis\\n is doing the legal. The elder Travis? Yes, Count Dracula\\n himself. Big bonus if you win. Let's play poker. I got a figure in\\n the back of my mind. Let's see how close\\n you can get to it. A hundred million. If we auctioned it off,\\n it'll get done at 175. (SCOFFS) Maybe\\n five years ago. Not with a market\\n this unstable. Excuse me, Mr. Travis.\\n Telephone call for you. Excuse me. It's too bad we have\\n to go through all this. It's just gonna\\n get done at 140. How's that? Oh, Travis is gonna\\n come back in here. He's gonna say that the two\\n of you have to go somewhere. That's supposed to make me\\n think he's got another offer. Watch this. I'm terribly sorry,\\n but something important\\n has come up. Julie. I'd be willing\\n to go 155, but... You know, there are 100\\n strategic buyers in Tokyo\\n who will do this for 150. I've got a figure\\n in the back of my mind, and you haven't even\\n come close to it yet. Well, young man,\\n you drive a hard bargain. 140 million, then, eh? I can live with that. Bravo, bravo.\\n Very impressive, Bill. I almost forgot\\n it was my money. I'm going to my house\\n in Oaxaca for the weekend.\\n Let's do the paperwork there. Terrific. I can\\n fly there Saturday. That would be wonderful. There's no phone, so here's\\n my caretaker's number and he'll make arrangements\\n for a car to pick you up. All right.\\n Well, thank you. And bring\\n your bathing suit. Or don't. No.\\n \\\"No\\\" what? No, you can't have\\n the weekend off. Well, every time you\\n want something from me,\\n you interlock your fingers. Sorry, Jenny. I need\\n you here all weekend. I'm going to Mexico\\n to close Daisy Cellular. Your sister's on line one.\\n She's been calling all day. Hmm. Hello.\\n Hi, Bill. Hey, Marci. Bill, you've got to come\\n up here right away. Peter's being\\n blackmailed and... Mom's fine. Listen,\\n the guy who's blackmailing him\\n is coming to Buzzsaw tomorrow. Peter talked to him\\n on the phone and said\\n he's gonna kill him. Please come, just for the day.\\n You got to come, Bill. Please? Ah, no, I'm sorry, Marci.\\n I'm very, very busy.\\n I really can't. But, Bill,\\n you don't understand.\\n I mean, this is real. Anyway, you promised\\n you'd come if\\n I ever needed you. You've got to come.\\n Please? (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello, Mr. Buchenwald. True, but if we make\\n a crossover in Japan, we'll\\n get a topping bid in a day. (SIREN WAILING) Soon as the papers\\n are signed. Uh... I have to call you back,\\n Mr. Buchenwald. Shit. Shit. (SCREAMING) Okay, quiet,\\n please. Quiet. Quiet, please. Thank you. Marci, who is\\n the girl on the motorcycle? Oh, her name's Sally,\\n and she's very nice. Oh, she's nice?\\n I thought she was being\\n chased by the police. No, she wasn't being\\n chased by the police. Actually, the cop\\n who was shooting at her\\n was a friend of hers. Marci, what kind of a\\n friend shoots at you? A boyfriend. Yeah. Yes? I know he will disagree, but I don't like\\n the way Sally's\\n brought into the story. I don't quite disagree. I must say\\n my earlier optimism\\n is beginning to waver. Those guys\\n are bothering me. Just tell your story,\\n and if it's good,\\n they won't bother you anymore. I'm not so sure. All right, pull it over.\\n Let's go. All right, come on. WOMAN ON TAPE:\\n In the following exercise,\\n listen and learn. (MAN SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) WOMAN: How are the children?

I don't think you'd shoot me. Here's the deal. I'm gonna pull over at\\n the nearest police station then I'm gonna\\n let you out. (GUN COCKS) You like to gamble?\\n There are two bullets left, so the odds\\n are in your favor. (CLICKS)\\n (GASPS) Sayonara.\\n Okay. Okay, okay. Turn into that field. SALLY: Stop here.\\n Leave the keys. Can't we find some kind\\n of middle ground here? Get out. How far do you think\\n you're gonna get? I'm just gonna walk\\n to the nearest\\n police station. Won't you be a little\\n embarrassed walking naked\\n into a police station? Oh, you wouldn't\\n do that. I'll count to five. All right.\\n All right. I'm takin' them off. This is ridiculous. One. You can't just leave\\n me here in the middle\\n of nowhere, naked. (SCREAMING) MARCI: Luckily,\\n this car arrived with\\n two very nice guys in it. and everybody likes them\\n because they're always reay\\n to do favors for people. (SCHOOL CHILDREN SCREAMING) Hi. I was robbed and\\n my car was stolen. MAN ONE: Hop in.\\n MAN TWO: Yeah, come on. I got to go to\\n the police station. You remember how you get\\n to the police station? I never drive when\\n they take me there. Is there any place\\n else you wanna go? Well, just drop me\\n off in Buzzsaw. You from Eureka? No. Name's Jim.\\n This here's my brother. His name's Jim too. How do you do?\\n Bill Campbell. We were named after\\n different people though. I was named after BOTH: Dad. And he was named\\n after our grandpa.\\n Grandpa. Grandpa Jim.\\n Yeah. Do you guys know where\\n I could get some clothes? Why? Because I don't\\n have any on. (CHUCKLES) We don't hardly\\n ever buy clothes. When mine get worn,\\n I just borrow a pair of\\n Jim's here and vice versa. I need a beer. BILL: Here you go. There's always\\n field clothes.\\n Yeah. Field clothes? Yeah, this is the season\\n they come out. Yeah. And they're free. Jim here\\n plays the guitar. Uh-huh. Kinda. Wanna hear?\\n We got a tape. (STRUMMING GUITAR) JIM SR: (ON TAPE)\\n Want a beer?

Jim! That's my road,\\n right there.\\n Oh. We ain't never been\\n down that road before. We normally don't go where\\n we haven't already been. That way we\\n don't get lost. Except once in a while. Of course.\\n Smart thinking. Yeah. I'm out of here. Okay. Bye.\\n Good luck. Bye-bye.\\n Thank you. Okay. MARCI:\\n Bill had to walk about\\n a mile to get to the hou. A mile barefoot on a road\\n full of sharp little sto. With each step,\\n Bill was thinking of Sally, and you can bet they\\n weren't very nice thoughts. Damn. (SIREN APPROACHING) (CAR APPROACHING) Hi, my car broke\\n down back there. Can you give me a lift\\n to the bus depot? No problem. We just got to\\n tank up first. Yeah. Ugh. Jim,\\n you all right?

Oh, now.\\n Okay, sure.\\n Oh, now. SALLY: I thought\\n this was a shortcut.\\n Where are we? JIM SR:\\n Don't worry. We just lost\\n the road temporarily. It's okay. We've been lost\\n in these woods before. When the stars come out,\\n we'll have a better idea\\n of where we are. SALLY: Okay, that's it. I'll take\\n my chances alone. Okay.\\n Okay. Ready, Jim? Yeah. Jim! Jim! Jim! (DOG BARKING) Bill! Guess what?\\n That guy's coming today and Peter has to\\n give him $150,000. Hmm. First,\\n I want a kiss. I told Mom she shouldn't\\n marry him. He's evil. Here's what I want. I want the three of us,\\n you, me and Peter, to sit down someplace\\n and have a good, long talk. I don't wanna talk\\n to a criminal. I know it's hard\\n for you adjusting\\n to a new stepfather. Especially when\\n he's criminal. He's not a criminal, Marci.\\n You just don't like him. He is a criminal.\\n He is a criminal.\\n He is a criminal. Why're you so stubborn,\\n you little knucklehead? Why are you dressed\\n like Huckleberry Finn? Hey, Dudley.\\n How's Dudley? Good boy. Good. (PHONE RINGING) Buzzsaw police. Yes, I'd like to report\\n a stolen car, please. A stolen car? Could you hold,\\n please? My God,\\n what happened\\n to you?

Well, what's so complicated\\n about a stolen car? (BARKING) Come on, Dudley. Well, I'll tell\\n you what to do.\\n You have a C.B.? Great. Call the county police,\\n ask them if\\n they found a car.

He's having an affair.\\n This time I'm positive,\\n I think. Remember my friend Mandy\\n from the Junior League? Exact same thing happened\\n with her husband. Late work days\\n and mysterious hang ups. You don't know what it's\\n like to answer the phone and hear that\\n awful click again and again.\\n Click, click, click. Honey, I got some\\n business in town... Monkey business. Hello, Bill. How nice\\n to see you again. Hi, Peter. Listen,\\n I need to talk to you when you get\\n a chance, please. It's about Marci. Sure, sure, I see.\\n I'll try and make myself\\n available sometime. Hello? You found it?\\n Where? Excellent. Don't touch anything.\\n I'll be right there. MARCI:\\n Meanwhile, Bill found\\n his car, but not his walle. And the Buzzsaw police\\n were no help. In fact,\\n they were kind of weird. My wallet's gone. Right. Now you say\\n she kidnapped you? Kidnapped you and then\\n she took your car? You got to help me.\\n I got to get\\n that wallet back. See, the problem\\n here is that Sheriff Hawks\\n and Deputy Logan went\\n away for the weekend to Eureka for\\n the California State\\n Sheriff's Day Parade. And, see, I was hired\\n originally part-time just to do some\\n filing and light typing. Larry here...\\n It's my first day. It's his first day\\n as deputy, you see. And we said we would fill in\\n until they got back, but nobody said there\\n would be a kidnapping. I haven't even\\n been trained yet. BILL: You don't understand\\n how important this is. There's a caretaker's\\n phone number in the wallet. If I don't call him\\n by Friday, I've blown\\n a $140 million deal. Can you describe\\n the caretaker? What's with this town?\\n Is there somethin'\\n in the water? Not that I\\n know of, sir. Nobody said anything\\n about the water to us\\n except you just now. MAN: Sir? You need\\n a new oil pan. I jerry-rigged\\n a patch, but, uh... Okay, what are\\n you telling me? Just that we'll try, sir.\\n Definitely try. But that we are not\\n equipped to deal with\\n anything dangerous you know, like\\n a real crime or\\n anything like that. (GUN COCKS) Hello, Matty. Well, Mayor Van Der Haven.\\n That's a funny name. Dutch? Yes, as a matter\\n of fact it is. So, I guess you'll\\n be needing a little\\n traveling money. Yeah, $150,000. That's $10,000\\n for every year I spent\\n in prison for you, you son-of-a-bitch! MARCI: There was a witness\\n to this family reunion. Sally, who was trying to fd\\n her way through the woods and who was about toe\\n totally grossed out. Now there's no need\\n for threats, Matt. Just hold it right there. Oh, come, come, come, Matt.\\n I'm not like you. I don't carry a gun. I'm the mayor of Buzzsaw,\\n for Christ's sake. (GUNSHOTS) You always were\\n a liar and a cheat! No wonder you became\\n a politician! And a good one. PETER: Matt? Matt, now take it easy. Asshole! Matty, Matty, Matty. Don't be childish. Stay away from me! PETER:\\n You remember when Mom said\\n we'd kill each other someday? (CHUCKLES) She was right! Stay where you are! Ugh. Jenny, any luck\\n reaching that caretaker? No, I'm going crazy. I've called 500 numbers.\\n At this rate, I'm going\\n to be at it all week. You call all\\n the Jose Rodriguezes within\\n 100 miles south of Oaxaca and I'll call all\\n the ones to the north. (SIGHS) Lights out, honey. It's already past\\n your bedtime. Oh, five more\\n minutes, Mom. Sorry, time's up. Oh, God, Marci,\\n where did you find this? No. This is going\\n down right now. But, Mom, I can't\\n sleep without that. You're just gonna have\\n to learn to, dear. Good night, honey. Good night, Mom. Hey, Matt.\\n Matt? My name's Peter\\n Van Der Haven.\\n Who are you? (SCOFFS) Don't give\\n me that crap, Matt. I figured you'd try\\n and double-cross me. (CHUCKLES)\\n You've got\\n the wrong man. Get off my property or\\n I'll call the police. Hey, four eyes.\\n I told you\\n not to... Well, that's very good.\\n That's very smart, Virgil. So, where's\\n the money? He didn't have it,\\n so I had to kill him. VIRGIL: Son of a bitch!\\n What are we supposed\\n to do now? MATT: I'll tell you\\n what I'm gonna do now. I'm gonna go into\\n that house and I'm gonna\\n become Peter Van Der Haven. And you are gonna lay low. And when the time comes,\\n you're gonna get\\n your 10 percent. Now get! Ten percent?\\n It's 50/50, Matt. Who the hell told you\\n your brother was the mayor\\n of Buzzsaw anyway, huh? Who told you? It was me! I'm the mayor of Buzzsaw,\\n and this is the new deal! Oh, no! No, Matt!\\n What are you doing? Bill! Bill!\\n Guess what? Peter's dead and his\\n twin brother killed him\\n and took his place! Hold on. Marci,\\n it's very late,\\n and I'm busy. And he killed\\n this other guy, too.\\n I saw it on my wall! I think you're\\n having a bad dream. No.\\n Yes, and you should\\n go to sleep. But...\\n We'll talk in the morning.\\n It's okay. Go ahead, go to sleep. Go to sleep. It's okay.\\n Good night. MARCI: As usual,\\n Bill didn't believe me and I didn't know\\n what to think. Maybe it was just\\n a bad dream after all. (MATT GRUNTING)\\n (BODY THUDDING) But the next morning,\\n I realized that it wasn't\\n a bad dream at all. There was a murderer\\n in the house, all righ. Oh, shit! Esta es la casa\\n de Jose Rodriguez. EsJose? Mmm, uh, mmm.\\n No. Gracias. Come to the dining room, Bill.\\n Breakfast is ready. Marci! (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello? Hi, Peter.\\n It's me, Melissa. This isn't Peter.\\n Just a second.\\n (DIAL TONE) Hello? It's her. It's that woman\\n who's always\\n hanging up on me. What did she say? Just, \\\"Peter,\\n it's me, Melissa.\\\" Melissa? Huh,\\n I know her name now. Melissa.\\n Melissa the whore. You okay, Mom? MATT: Son-of-a-bitch!\\n (CRASHING) That's the second time\\n he's fallen this morning. Must've forgotten there's\\n a step in the bathroom. All this sex\\n is rotting his brain. (GRUNTING) Peter, why are you going\\n through my panties? I'm... I'm lookin'\\n for a tie.
